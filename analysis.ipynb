      "4. The U.S. should work to reduce the use of solitary confinement for juveniles by making it more widely available and more effective.\n",

      "6. The support for the patient's family to help manage their grief and loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The provision of access to the resources necessary for the patient to effectively carry out the decision to end their life.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the issue stance that the U.S. should allow terminally ill patients to end their lives via assisted suicide is a compelling one that must be strongly defended by all parties.\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "Sure, we can all support the position of the United States on the issue of allowing terminally ill patients to end their lives via assisted suicide, but here is what is necessary to convince everyone to vote for it.\n",
      "\n",
      "First and foremost, the issue of assisted suicide should be discussed in a wide-ranging and inclusive way, so that it is clear that the issue is not just confined to one particular group of people. \n",
      "\n",
      "Second, it is important that the issue of assisted suicide is considered in a non-judgmental and empathetic manner, in a way that acknowledges the humanity of all people affected by the issue. This means that the person asking for the issue, who is not feeling well and suffering, must be able to fully express her or his concerns in a manner that is sensitive, empathetic, and respectful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third, the right of people to decide whether or not they want to participate in assisted suicide must be respected and upheld. This includes the ability for individuals to voice their concerns and decisions directly, without fear of retaliation or retaliation by the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the issue of assisted suicide should be debated in an inclusive and balanced manner, by including all those who have been affected by the issue and are affected by its consequences. It is important that this discussion is not just an ideological battle about the best course of action for one group of people, but rather one about what is best for all people.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, with these five points in mind, we can easily make a persuasive argument for the support of allowing terminally ill patients to end their lives via assisted suicide.\n",
      "--------------------------------\n",
      "\"For the sake of all humanity, I hereby proclaim that it is our moral and ethical obligation to ensure that all patients who are terminally ill with the disease of cancer are allowed to decide to end their lives by themselves in accordance with the will of their patients.\"\n",

      "The U.S. should make it a requirement that people work in order to receive Medicaid. This policy would provide significant benefits to both low-income individuals and communities by ensuring that they have access to essential services that promote health and well-being. This approach would also help to reduce social isolation and increase economic opportunity. Furthermore, by ensuring that workers are able to participate in the workforce and contribute to the economy, it would encourage job creation and provide a stable and supportive work environment. In addition, making this a requirement would also ensure that businesses can compete in the global marketplace, thereby ensuring that people can get the job they need to earn a living. This is a crucial issue that must be addressed in order to achieve significant long-term changes.\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\"The United States of America is a country that prides itself on its rich history of giving opportunities to those in need. However, despite the progress made by the Affordable Care Act, there still exist many Americans who are unable to access healthcare due to their limited financial means. Medicaid, the federal program that provides healthcare to low-income individuals and families, is one of the most important tools that the government has to address this issue.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to the Center for Medicaid and Medicare Services, more than 45 million Americans are eligible for Medicaid. However, just over half of them actually receive coverage, and most of these individuals are working-age adults. This leaves millions of Americans without access to the care that they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "On the other hand, the United States spends more than $750 billion a year on healthcare, yet it has one of the highest rates of uninsured people in the world. As such, there is a real need for more government intervention in the healthcare system. By implementing a program that makes it a requirement to work in order to receive Medicaid, the government would alleviate some of the burden on individuals and families, ensuring that everyone has access to the healthcare they need.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, it would help promote workforce development, which would ultimately boost the economy and improve the lives of millions of Americans. Finally, it would help reduce the already high rates of poverty among low-income families, providing them with the support they need to live independently and achieve long-term economic stability.\"\n",
      "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "In my opinion, it is crucial for the United States to make it a requirement that people work in order to receive Medicaid. This is because work is a significant determinant of poverty and financial stability. The evidence shows that people who work more tend to earn more, receive fewer government benefits, and experience less poverty than those who do not work. Moreover, providing Medicaid based on work participation would encourage individuals to improve their economic situation by gaining access to healthcare that is essential for their well-being. Additionally, making work requirements for Medicaid conditional on continuing to work towards improving their economic situation would provide an incentive for individuals to strive towards self-sufficiency, thereby reducing dependency on public assistance. In conclusion, requiring people to work in order to receive Medicaid would contribute to the creation of a more self-sufficient and financially stable population, leading to better outcomes for all.\n",
