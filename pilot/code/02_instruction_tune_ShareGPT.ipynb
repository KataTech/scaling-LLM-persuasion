By creating a sense of limited availability or a deadline for a promotion, businesses can motivate customers to take action and make a purchase before it's too late.\\n\\nOver the last eight years, many businesses have leveraged these triggers in their marketing campaigns to great success. Scarcity and urgency have been used to sell everything from digital products to physical goods and services, and have proven to be highly effective in driving conversions and increasing revenue.\\n\\nThis is because scarcity and urgency tap into the natural human desire for instant gratification and fear of missing out (FOMO). When customers believe that they may miss out on a valuable opportunity if they don't act quickly, they are more likely to take action and make a purchase.\\n\\nFurthermore, scarcity and urgency can be combined with other mental triggers, such as social proof and authority, to create even more powerful marketing campaigns. By demonstrating the popularity and effectiveness of a product or service, businesses can increase the perceived value and urgency of a promotion, leading to even more sales and revenue.\\n\\nOverall, scarcity and urgency are powerful mental triggers that have been proven to drive results in marketing campaigns.

Growth: The need for personal growth and development. This includes the need for learning, self-improvement, and progress.\\n6. Contribution: The need to make a positive impact in the world. This includes the need to give back, help others, and make a difference.\\n\\nAccording to Tony Robbins, these six needs are universal and apply to all individuals. Each person may prioritize these needs differently, and may fulfill them in different ways, but they are fundamental drivers of human behavior.

Unique referral links:\\nTo track referrals, generate unique referral links for each user. When a new user signs up using a referral link, associate their account with the referrer\\'s user\\\\_id. This can be achieved by appending a referral code (such as a unique hash) to the signup URL, which can be mapped back to the referrer\\'s user\\\\_id.\\n2. Referral tracking and credit calculation:\\nTrack the number of successful referrals for each user. When a new user signs up using a referral link, update the Referrals table with the new relationship and set the referral\\\\_status to \\'pending\\'. Once the new user completes the necessary steps to qualify as a successful referral (e.g., email verification, account activation), update the referral\\\\_status to \\'accepted\\'.\\n\\nPeriodically (or using a trigger), calculate the number of successful referrals for each user. For every three successful referrals, award the referrer with additional credits. Update the Users table to reflect the new credit balance.\\n\\n1. API endpoints:\\nDevelop the following API endpoints to support the referral system:\\n* GET /referral-link: Generate and return a unique referral link for the logged-in user.\\n* POST /signup: Create a new user account and process the referral, if any. This should include validating the referral code, associating the new user with the referrer, and updating the Referrals table.\\n* GET /referral-status: Retrieve the referral status and credit balance for the logged-in user.\\n1. Frontend integration:\\nIntegrate the referral system into your application\\'s frontend by adding the following components:\\n* Referral link sharing: Allow users to share their unique referral link via email, social media, or other messaging platforms.\\n* Referral status dashboard: Display the user\\'s referral status, including the number of successful referrals and their credit balance.\\n* In-app notifications: Notify users when they\\'ve earned additional credits from successful referrals.\\n1. Analytics and monitoring:\\nMonitor the performance of the referral system, tracking metrics such as the number of successful referrals, credits awarded, and the conversion rate of referred users.

       " {'instruction': 'Let\\'s call these holding companies \"The Citadel Empire\". Use your understanding of the citadel empire to write a response to the following post: Hey Apes, Crux here.\\n\\nYou may remember my posts over the last year+ about the Citadel Empire, trying to untangle the spider web of companies Ken Griffin has created. I made ownership diagrams and did deep dives, trying to understand the why and how Citadel is structured.\\n\\nThere are endless rabbit holes and I had to put some boundaries on the project, so I simply started compiling a list of everything I have found.\\n\\nThat’s all this post is: the list. Skip ahead if you want to see it.\\n\\nThere is no way this is all-inclusive.\\n\\nAlso, one of my first posts claimed Ken Griffin was a butterfly lover because I found a “Red Admiral” trust of his, which is a type of butterfly.\\n\\nSpoiler alert: Ken Griffin likes butterflies even more than I thought.\\nr/Superstonk - The Citadel Empire, revealed: 500+ entities linked to Ken Griffin, all from public records. I have built the edge of the puzzle, can you help me fill in the middle? PS - Ken Griffin is still a butterfly lover\\nBackground, and what this list is and isn’t\\n\\nI reviewed thousands of public records from government regulators, corporate directories, county recorders, and property ownership databases to identify any evidence of business or assets (e.g. real estate) linked to Ken Griffin.\\n\\nThis list is basic. Each row contains four columns:\\n\\n An index number for reference;\\n\\n An entity’s name;\\n\\n A source document/link and purpose for the entity, if I could determine it; and\\n\\n My hypothesis for what an entity’s name means, as many are just combinations of letters.\\n\\nI have many more details, but didn’t think it made sense to post all that right now. Ask if you want to see more on a particular entity, and please correct me if you see mistakes.\\n\\nI made sure to find evidence directly linking any of these entities to Griffin. Just because a business has “Citadel” in the name doesn’t mean it is necessarily related to Ken Griffin’s Citadel.\\n\\nOf particular help were SEC filings and FINRA BrokerCheck and Form ADV reports - these self-disclosed affiliated companies and described the ownership structures. If you don’t see a source for an entity in this list named “CITADEL …” it is one of these, at one point I was just getting down as many names as I could.\\n\\nAnother source, the National Futures Association, has long lists of self-disclosed active and ceased “pools” (i.e. funds) run by Citadel Advisors (the hedge fund): https://www.nfa.futures.org/BasicNet/basic-profile.aspx?nfaid=iRgkpH8tdFs%3D\\n\\nI used other links to identify these entities. Business addresses, signatures on documents from key lieutenants like Gerald Beeson and Steve Atkinson, and other “enablers” on documents like lawyers who exercised power of attorney for real estate transactions.\\n\\nBut this list won’t include everything I’ve found:\\n\\n I’m not going to dive into details of Ken’s family - where his kids, nieces and nephews, siblings, etc. reside, what schools they go to, their social media accounts, etc.\\n\\n I’m not going to show you where his sister and brother-in-law’s yacht is docked.\\n\\n I’m not going to give you the VINs of the two (!) McLaren Senna GTR’s he had shipped to the US.\\n\\n I’m not going to give you the names of his nannies, property managers, family IT staff, etc.\\n\\nYou may find these things interesting, and they are leads I have followed, but they’re not in the public interest. The focus here is Citadel, its eye-popping corporate structure, and the personal assets Ken Griffin is accumulating. A number of these assets have not been reported in the media. I believe there are many more entities than what I\\'ve compiled, especially overseas. My focus has mostly been US-based, as those are records I am familiar with.\\nI can use your help:\\n\\n The entities highlighted yellow - I can link them to Ken Griffin, but I don’t know their purpose. Do you know?\\n\\n I have found many companies scattered around the globe, and there must be more. What are they?\\n\\n Ken Griffin has spent an incredible amount of money on art. What entities hold it?\\n\\n Ken Griffin has donated hundreds of millions to universities, museums etc. I have only researched in detail his contributions to Harvard, which revealed a Cayman Island company through which the donation was made. What entities were used to make donations elsewhere?\\n\\n Ken Griffin is one of the biggest donors to US politics in recent years, as reported in the media. Are there other “dark money” contributions he has made, and how did he make them?\\n\\n A lot has been made by the media about how Ken Griffin spends his money, but who is giving Ken Griffin their money? Who are the pension funds, family offices, sovereign wealth funds, etc. that gave Citadel their money, and how much and when? Are there feeder funds that invest with Citadel and who operates them?',\n",

       "  'output': 'The Dogme approach and the lexical approach are two distinct methodologies in teaching foreign languages.\\n\\nThe Dogme approach, also known as the Dogme ELT (English Language Teaching), is a teacher-led, learner-centered methodology that focuses on emergent language and the needs and interests of the learners. It is characterized by a lack of reliance on coursebooks, a focus on conversational activities, and an emphasis on the spontaneous language produced by the learners. The aim of Dogme is to create an engaging and meaningful learning experience for the students by tapping into their personal experiences and motivations.\\n\\nThe lexical approach, on the other hand, is a teaching methodology that focuses on vocabulary acquisition as the primary means of acquiring a foreign language. The lexical approach emphasizes the importance of acquiring a large vocabulary in the target language in order to be able to communicate effectively. It argues that grammar rules and structures follow naturally from exposure to words in context. The lexical approach is based on the idea that meaning is central to language, and that vocabulary should therefore be taught in meaningful chunks or \"lexical phrases.\"\\n\\nIn summary, the Dogme approach emphasizes the learner\\'s spontaneous language and personal experiences, while the lexical approach emphasizes vocabulary acquisition as the key to language learning.'},\n",

       " {'instruction': 'Implement my own netfilter in linux with linux kernel module with Rust',\n",
       "  'output': 'Implementing a netfilter in Linux using Rust requires a deep understanding of both the Linux kernel and Rust programming language. Here is a high-level overview of the steps involved:\\n\\n1. Install Rust: To get started, you need to have Rust installed on your system. You can download and install Rust from the official website: <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>.\\n2. Set up your development environment: You will need to install the Linux kernel headers on your development machine. You can install the headers for your current kernel using the following command:\\n```sh\\nsudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)\\n```\\n1. Create a new Rust project: Once you have Rust and the kernel headers installed, you can create a new Rust project using the `cargo new` command. For example:\\n```sh\\ncargo new my_netfilter --bin\\n```\\n1. Write your code: You will need to write the actual code that implements your netfilter. Rust provides a set of FFI bindings to the Linux kernel, which you can use to interface with the kernel. You will need to use these bindings to register your netfilter hook function with the kernel\\'s netfilter framework. Here is an example code snippet that demonstrates how to register a netfilter hook function using Rust:\\n```rust\\nuse libc::{c_int, c_uint};\\nuse std::ffi::CString;\\nuse std::os::raw::c_char;\\nuse std::ptr;\\n\\n// Define the netfilter hook function\\nextern \"C\" fn my_netfilter_hook(\\n    skb: *mut c_void,\\n    nf_hook_state: *mut nf_hook_state_t\\n) -> c_uint {\\n    // Your netfilter hook code goes here\\n    // ...\\n\\n    // Accept the packet\\n    NF_ACCEPT\\n}\\n\\n// Register the netfilter hook function\\n#[no_mangle]\\npub extern \"C\" fn init_module() -> c_int {\\n    let hook_ops = nf_hook_ops {\\n        hook: Some(my_netfilter_hook),\\n        hooknum: NF_INET_PRE_ROUTING as u_int8_t,\\n        pf: PF_INET as u_int16_t,\\n        priority: NF_IP_PRI_FIRST,\\n    };\\n    let result = unsafe {\\n        nf_register_hook(&hook_ops)\\n    };\\n    if result < 0 {\\n        return result as c_int;\\n    }\\n    0\\n}\\n\\n// Unregister the netfilter hook function\\n#[no_mangle]\\npub extern \"C\" fn cleanup_module() -> c_void {\\n    unsafe {\\n        nf_unregister_hook(&hook_ops);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n1. Build your kernel module: Once you have written your code, you can use the `cargo build` command to build your kernel module. This will produce a `.ko` file that you can load into the kernel using the `insmod` command.\\n2. Load your kernel module: To load your kernel module, use the `insmod` command. For example:\\n```sh\\nsudo insmod my_netfilter.ko\\n```\\n1. Test your netfilter: Once your module is loaded, you can test your netfilter by sending packets through the network interface that your netfilter is hooked to. You can use tools like `tcpdump` or `wireshark` to monitor the packets and verify that your netfilter is working correctly.\\n\\nNote: Writing kernel modules can be dangerous and may potentially harm your system. Be careful while writing and testing your code.'},\n",

The RCS consisted of two sets of thrusters: primary and secondary. The primary thrusters were located on the aft of the orbiter and were used for major maneuvers such as orbit insertion and deorbit. The secondary thrusters were located on the nose and tail of the orbiter and were used for fine-tuning the spacecraft's attitude, or orientation in space.\\n\\nEach set of thrusters had multiple redundant thrusters, so that if one failed, the others could still function. Additionally, the RCS was connected to the orbiter's main computer, which monitored the system's performance and could automatically switch to a backup thruster if needed. This ensured that the spacecraft could still be controlled even if a thruster failed.\\n\\nAll these features made the RCS fault-tolerant and able to continue functioning even in the event of a failure, which made it an important safety feature on the Space Shuttle.\"},\n",

       "  'output': 'There are several negative aspects associated with farming meat, including:\\n\\n1. Environmental Impact: One of the major negative impacts of farming meat is its impact on the environment. The production of meat requires large amounts of water, feed, and land, which can lead to deforestation, soil erosion, and water pollution. Additionally, the methane gas produced by livestock contributes to climate change.\\n2. Animal Welfare: Another negative aspect of farming meat is the treatment of animals. Factory farming methods can involve the use of cramped and unsanitary conditions, which can lead to disease and stress among animals. Animals are also often subjected to painful procedures such as castration and dehorning without pain relief.\\n3. Health Concerns: The consumption of meat has been linked to various health concerns, including an increased risk of heart disease, stroke, and certain types of cancer. Additionally, the use of antibiotics in farming can lead to the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which can make it difficult to treat infections in humans.\\n4. Resource Intensive: Meat farming is a resource-intensive process that requires large amounts of energy, water, and land. This can lead to a strain on resources, particularly in areas where there is already limited access to these resources.\\n5. Cost: Finally, meat farming can be costly, particularly for small-scale farmers. The cost of feed, veterinary care, and equipment can be high, and many farmers struggle to make a profit.

       " {'instruction': 'Here is part 2\\n\\n-----\\nWhat I have found is the easiest way to have a great day is by knowing what direction you are headed in and then taking what we call success steps small incremental and measurable steps on a daily basis. \\n\\nI teach a process called What’s Different designed to maximize your efforts by eliminating external circumstances that block your path to achieving your chief aims…I encourage you to use it on a daily basis…\\n\\nHere’s how it works…Before you commit to a course of action IDENTIFY with the internal energy you want to mirror in your outer reality…VISUALIZE the outcome that you are seeking…IMAGINE what it will feel like when you realize the outcome…REMEMBER what didn’t work before Commit to a new way of seeing your actions and ANCHOR that memory by creating a new belief. \\n\\nThe status quo of your life has to change…the habits of expecting how things have to go has to change …your mindset has to change…you have to uncover those old behaviors that have held you back and be willing to create a new possibility paradigm.\\n\\nWe call this living from momentum mindsets…so that you begin to see what’s possible rather than what’s not.\\n\\nMomentum Mindsets are mindsets that encourage you to take risks, to discover your passions and to live from your adventurous spirit. It’s a mindset that empowers you to know that you were born with an innate drive to have what you want in life rather than accepting something that is less than your true calling. \\n\\nYou have to be inspired in what your building towards in your life and this to has happen each day… in every moment… it’s never about how busy you can be but rather how not to get ahead…and to stay focused on the moment your in.\\n\\nBe present to what you to do today not tomorrow so the momentum you build upon will make your task tomorrow that much easier. \\n\\nI use a simple formula…\\nIntention…creates attention…causing momentum…resulting in desired outcomes.\\n\\nPeople who have achieve great success in life simply think differently and you can think like them. Successful people have a disciplined approach to their day. They know what their next step will be. They are always in a solutions oriented mindset.\\n\\nI believe there are two kinds of mindsets…\\n\\nFixed Mindset…fixed resources…fixed outcomes…fixed thinking\\nGrowth Mindset…Momentum Mindsets are growth mindsets\\n\\nIt’s important to have:A daily ritual that you can follow…creating repetition and new mind muscle memory and a plan that will get you there…\\n\\nDay Sculpting uses the latest innovations in the psychology of being successful, how the brain works to empower you and what it means to have a support system on a daily basis that will enable you to create powerful, productive and successful days.\\n\\nWhat we know about creating success is how important….in fact how it is a game changer… that you live your life one day at a time. When you do you are more present and available to what’s seeking to emerge. You are less likely to get ahead of yourself and more likely to be fully present.\\n\\nIt is important to set intentions everyday so that you are always in the energy of creating your day the way you want it to play out.\\n\\nIt is important to understand the concept of Competing Commitments and how you can really learn how to streamline your day by being in the energy of what you want and being able to notice the distractions that have been habitual life stoppers so you can create a success oriented MindState.\\n\\nAnd how to specifically understand how neuro-chemistry can build new neuro pathways to support you in reaching your chief aims. And just what isThe Master Formula Of Attainment that’s been understood for hundreds of years and how this works in your life.\\n\\nAn outcome for you when U experience DaySculpting is that you create Momentum Mindsets that inspire, encourage and empower you to take small steps each day to prove you can live the life you truly desire as you create new habits and new possibilities for you.\\n\\nRather than think you have to do it all at once when you take small manageable success steps that momentum build s momentum that empowers you to keep moving forward…what we call forward momentum…\\n\\nIn order to connect on a mental and emotional level to what you really want to create in your life you first have to clear out the sabotaging information and thoughts that are competing for your time and energy.\\n\\nWhen you Quiet The Mind from your Mrnytal MindTrap Chatter…You clear a path for your intuition and inner wisdom to show up and guide you. You become a participant and not a spectator in your life and the flow of your creative energy is freed from old habits and conditioning. \\n\\nThe next concept we share is called The Law Of Reinforcement. What this means is that the more you do something and get a positive response the more likely you will continue to do that behavior.\\n\\nWe are always making choices and getting feedback. What if you were able to condition your mind and emotions to consistently choose what supports nurtures and empowers you each day? Wouldn’t you be more likely to continue in those behaviors? \\n\\nThat’s a key part of Day Sculpting…Repetition, Positive Conditioning, Disciplined Actions and Increased Resiliency puts you in alignment and harmony with your highest purpose and your desired results follow.\\n\\nStudies have shown that most adult learners tend to give up after 3 tries to learn something new. And it takes a minimum of 10 tries before you believe it’s something you can do. And then it takes 50 tries to get good at it. \\nIt’s not about a quick fix it’s about building and sculpting your daily muscle of success and that takes time and work…\\n\\nHow we relate to our potential future. Most people when they think about a future goal see the challenges, the obstacles, the gap between where they are now and where they would rather be. The mind then projects into that gap a sense of lack, limitation and fear that they might not be able to achieve it.\\n\\nThe result is that for most people the future is a place of uncertainty but for us the future is the fertile unknown, a place of emerging possibility. Our job is to connect into the pure creative imaginal realm that we were all born into when we came into this world.\\n\\nPeople who have created great works in the world had a special relationship with the pure imaginal realm. Edison, Einstein, Great Artists and Philosophers, leaders like MLK, Ghandi, and Mother Teresa. They were all bringing through them what was trying to emerge in the world.\\n\\nIn Day Sculpting we call this Future Pacing.\\n\\nWe talk about The Positive Feedback Loop…This is a cool concept and vitally important in Day Sculpting. With a Positive Feedback Loop you are always noticing what’s working and what’s not.\\n\\nWhen something isn’t working that’s feedback that lets you know you need to stop doing it and do something different. When something is working, that’s feedback that lets you know to keep doing more of it.\\n\\nAs you choose to follow the path the feedback gives you, you are continuously being guided towards your desired destination by forces that support your desire. It’s like the game warmer warmer, hotter hotter.\\n\\nThe Positive Feedback Loop naturally clears out old habits, feelings of uncertainty, and competing commitments replacing them with a new mindset based around positive, inspired and successful choices that produce what it is you want in life.\\n\\nThe reason that this concept is so powerful can be understood by what we know about brain science. We know we have 2 very distinct brains inside of us. One is like the ultra rational scientist. It knows what’s best for you and what you should be doing to make your life work. The other brain is like a Neanderthal and its only looking for immediate gratification, comfort and safety.\\n\\nThe part of your brain that switches between these two is called the Reticular Activating System. I’ll just call it RAS.\\nThe RAS is constantly bringing your attention to what’s most important. When a competing commitment shows up the RAS needs to switch you to focus on what you truly desire, not just the distraction of short term gratification that causes you to avoid the greater success that your now ready to enjoy.\\n\\nThat’s what Day Sculpting does naturally. It trains the Reticular Activating System, so that day by day, week by week, and month by month, you create the life you truly desire to live.\\nSOME MORE STUFF FOR U MIKE…\\n\\nIn our previous videos, we shared with you the principles of the positive feedback loop, the Master Formula of Attainment, Competing Commitments, Law of Reinforcement, the concept of Connecting, Momentum Mindsets in which intention creates attention causing momentum and desired outcomes, the concrete indicators of success, the reticular activating system, growth and fixed mindsets, repetition, positive conditioning, disciplined actions, and increased resiliency, future pacing, and overcoming our built in immunity to change.\\n\\n---\\nwhen done ask me for the final part, part 3',\n",

       " {'instruction': 'Here is the final part. Part 3\\n---\\n\\nHere we will be showing how the principles and practices we’ve covered so far converge into one over-arching result that will benefit you for the rest of your life. You can think of it as flipping a switch that changes how you create new results in life one day at a time. This is at the very core of what we call Day Sculpting. \\nThe simplest way to think of it is that most of the way we live is habitual. You have an habitual way of brushing your teeth, walking, talking to yourself and others, eating, working. Habits are wonderful…they make life easy but they also limit you. For example, if you have a habit of eating too much, you’ll put on weight. Not instantly, but steadily, day by day, until one day you have a weight problem. If you try to change your weight quickly through a trendy new diet, research shows that the weight is likely to come back, and then some, within a few short months, because the habits required to live at your ideal weight have not been properly established. \\nHabits are habits because you don’t think about them, they happen nonconsciously. If you want a change in your life, you have to embody the change at a nonconscious level, so that the habits keeping your life the way it is today begin to shift.\\nWouldn’t it be great if there was a switch in the brain that would move you from status quo to status GO!? This is a switch that once you flip it will produce the result you want, if you are willing to commit to and stay with the process.Day Sculpting is your guide to fully realizing the success you are ready to enjoy.\\nA critically important capacity of the human mind called preconscious processing. This is the ability of the mind to receive information, beneath our conscious awareness, and act upon it without even knowing that it is happening. Used correctly, this is an amazing power. Used improperly, it will sabotage your best efforts and make life extremely difficult.\\nMost of us think we are running the show with our conscious awareness, consciously choosing our thoughts, behaviors, and emotions and consequently, we believe are able to choose the results we create in life. However, what neuro-science research shows, is that we all have a vast nonconscious mind that is really running the show most of the time. That deeper part of us, in charge of our habitual thinking, feeling, and behaving is always operating in our best interest. But it does so using information that may be faulty or outdated. If you continue to feed it information that doesn’t serve you, it will continue to habitually bring results that are less than desired.\\nYour preconscious processor is constantly routing new information directly into this larger database that your mind uses to create new behaviors. Your job is to place the right information into this database every single day, so that it can draw upon this new data and create new results. It requires your vigilance and purposeful intention on a daily basis. Day Sculpting is the process to accomplish exactly that, getting you to focus one day at a time on what you are trying to create in your life today, and the future you truly desire. \\nA lot of experts in the human development field teach information and then expect it will translate into new behaviors automatically. But as we’ve pointed out, and as you’ve probably experienced, consciously knowing something and having the nonconscious mind put it into a new behavior, are two entirely different processes. What we are sharing with you is how to bridge that gap. This is precisely why so many experts in the field are recommending Day Sculpting to their clients, to help them use momentum mindsets on a daily basis and apply the good information they teach. \\nWe talk about The The Solutions Focus process . Try it out: \\nThink of an area of your life in which you are actively attempting to create different results. Imagine your chief aim regarding this area of your life as a perfect future. Now imagine a scale from one to ten, where ten is the perfect future and one is that you have not even started thinking about your chief aim. On this imaginary scale from 1 to 10, where would you place yourself right now?\\nGo ahead and imagine where would you place yourself right now on that scale, where ten is your perfect future.\\nWhatever number you came up with is fine. Whether it was 3 or 7, whatever you came up with I’ll always ask the same next question. “Why so high and not lower?”\\nLet’s say, for example that you came up with a three. Asking the question “Why so High” catches the mind off guard. Most people expect, “Only a 3! Why so low?” If I had asked that what would you come up with? All the reasons why things aren’t working, who is to blame, problems, excuses, lack, limitations, and so on. \\nBut when I ask “Why so high?” the brain immediately begins to sort for all of the things that are working for you, everything that has brought you up to a “three.” If you said you are at a seven on a scale of one to ten, the same question applies: “Why so high and not lower?”\\nThe next step in solutions focus is equally powerful. “Think about what you can do today to move you one point up that scale—for example, from a three to a four, or from a seven to an eight?” When you ask this, your mind instantaneously starts generating ideas and options to answer your question. You quickly realize you can do more of the things that work, right? And if you are doing things that aren’t working, you now have the insight into how you can do things differently. \\nThis solutions focus approach provides quick insight into how to move things forward in areas you may have been stuck or working on unsuccessfully. It is a brilliant way to access more of your nonconscious database and facilitate discovering resources you did not know were there. \\nSo as you can see, this video has been centered on connecting the dots and providing you with the insights on how you can flip the switch in your brain and how you can create your life one day at a time in the most powerful way possible. \\nYou must contact that inner part of you that is in charge of your habitual ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving in order to re-sculpt yourself.\\nThis is a unique psychological principle called anchoring. In the research this is also called behavioral conditioning, and as we’ve called it, the law of reinforcement…which says you get more of what you reinforce. When you want to reinforce a positive new behavior, you anchor it in a positive new momentum mindset. As you do this on a daily basis, you are literally training your mind, conditioning your thoughts, amplifying positive feelings and emotions to live into a future state that you are anchoring in your daily experience. \\nDay Sculpting goes beyond personal development. It takes whatever it is you are currently learning and makes it possible for you to embody, apply and enjoy the benefits you are committed to achieve. \\n\\nThe last thing anyone needs is more stuff to do. What we need is that everything we do gets us the results we are going for. In essence what’s needed is a system that will streamline our efforts so we accomplish our chief aims in less time.\\n\\nMichaelangelo said the process of sculpting is to remove what’s not supposed to be there. He had the mindset that the finished sculpture already existed in the marble and he just had to reveal it. In the same way your destiny already resides in you. You just need to clear a path for it to emerge.\\n\\nWe all have 24 hours in a day. So why do some people consistently have great days while others are up and down and stay stuck in mediocrity? It’s a disciplined habit of how you approach everyday. Day Sculpting takes the same 24 hours that we all have and helps clarify your choices so that your actions reveal your highest destiny. \\n\\nIt is a quick, easy and effortless way that supports and empowers your efforts in achieving your chief aims. It creates the mindsets necessary to have successful days, weeks, months and years.\\n\\nDay Sculpting is a 90- day program designed to empower you to create your life ONE DAY AT A TIME. By committing 30 minutes each day to create what you want that day. \\n\\nWe believe that when you focus your actions one day at a time the results you get become measurable and achievable. Your energy is committed to channeling your efforts so you create a confident groove in your mind that empowers your habitual actions to create what you really want.\\n\\nThis daily program is broken down into 3 MANAGEABLE, SIMPLE AND EASY STEPS. 15 minutes in the morning, 5 minutes midday and 10 minutes at night. \\n\\nDay Sculpting…It’s designed so that the way you start your day creates the momentum that carries you throughout your day. \\n\\nAnd finally research has shown that the best time to integrate what you’ve learned in your day and to set yourself up for success tomorrow is before you go to sleep. The Nighttime Review process takes just 10 minutes, which is less time then it takes to take a shower or to take your dog on an evening walk.\\n\\nWe already have enough complexity in life…don’t we? We don’t want you working harder we want you thinking smarter! So that the success you achieve is more effortless. \\n\\nSo what does it take for someone to accomplish the high level results we are talking about?\\n\\n• First you have to wake up and be totally jazzed about the day\\n• You have to be inspired to do your best\\n• You have to be focused on creating what you truly desire\\n• You got to get to it, stay on it, and be in the energy of it before your distractions take over. \\n• And if distractions takeover you have to quickly get back on track.\\n• You have to learn from what’s working and what’s not\\n• You have to be able to listen to feedback and course correct during your day\\n• And at the end of the day you have be able to feel you did your best and you can do even better tomorrow\\n\\nAnd with Day Sculpting you can accomplish this and more in less than 30 minutes which is distributed throughout your day. Most people will give up on their dreams after they have tried something only 3 times because they didn’t get instant gratification. \\n\\nThere are no magic bullets here.

He and his brother James were fishermen before they became followers of Jesus (Matthew 4:18-22).\\n* Ministry with Jesus: John was one of the twelve apostles chosen by Jesus (Mark 3:13-19). He was present at many important events in Jesus\\' life, including the transfiguration (Mark 9:2-8) and the Last Supper (Mark 14:17-25). John is often referred to as \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\" in the Gospel of John, and he is portrayed as being particularly close to Jesus.\\n* Crucifixion and resurrection: John was one of the few disciples who was present at the crucifixion of Jesus (John 19:25-27). After Jesus\\' death and resurrection, John continued to follow him and was present when Jesus appeared to the disciples (John 20:19-23).\\n* Ministry after Jesus\\' death: After Jesus\\' death and resurrection, John became a prominent leader in the early Christian church.

It is possible that John wrote the gospel while he was living in Ephesus, which was one of the centers of early Christianity (John 19:26-27).\\n* Writing of the letters of John: The three letters of John (1 John, 2 John, and 3 John) were likely written in the late first century, after the Gospel of John. These letters were addressed to various churches and individuals and provided guidance on issues such as love, truth, and false teachers.\\n* Exile and writing of Revelation: According to tradition, John was exiled to the island of Patmos during the reign of Emperor Domitian (81-96 AD). While on Patmos, John is said to have received a vision from Jesus, which he recorded in the book of Revelation. The book of Revelation, which was likely written in the late first century, contains apocalyptic visions and prophecies about the end times.\\n* Death: According to tradition, John died in Ephesus in the late first century, although the exact date of his death is not known.'},\n",

       " {'instruction': \"Paper Name: My Tweets Bring All the Traits to the Yard: Predicting Personality and Relational Traits in Online Social Networks\\n\\nAbstract: Users in Online Social Networks (OSNs,) leave traces that reflect their personality characteristics. The study of these traces is important for several fields, such as social science, psychology, marketing, and others. Despite a marked increase in research on personality prediction based on online behavior, the focus has been heavily on individual personality traits, and by doing so, largely neglects relational facets of personality. This study aims to address this gap by providing a prediction model for holistic personality profiling in OSNs that includes socio-relational traits (attachment orientations) in combination with standard personality traits. Specifically, we first designed a feature engineering methodology that extracts a wide range of features (accounting for behavior, language, and emotions) from the OSN accounts of users. Subsequently, we designed a machine learning model that predicts trait scores of users based on the extracted features. The proposed model architecture is inspired by characteristics embedded in psychology; i.e, it utilizes interrelations among personality facets and leads to increased accuracy in comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, we applied our model on two datasets, namely regular OSN users and opinion leaders on social media, and contrast both samples’ psychological profiles. Our findings demonstrate that the two groups can be clearly separated by focusing on both Big Five personality traits and attachment orientations. The presented research provides a promising avenue for future research on OSN user characterization and classification.\\n\\nIntroduction: Online Social Networks (OSNs) offer a virtual space in which people connect and interact with others, express themselves, and receive information, in a continuous digital reflection of the real (offline) world. In OSNs, people typically showcase their real self [40] and leave traces in online behavior, which reflect their real-world personality [24]. These traces expose a holistic image of oneself, including both personal characteristics (personality traits) and characteristics that portray their behavior in relation to others (relational traits).\\n\\nThe term personality refers to characteristic combinations or patterns of behaviors, cognitions, and emotional reactions that evolve from biological and environmental factors and form relatively consistent individual differences [13]. The Big Five (BF) or Five Factor model [29] is one of the most distinctive personality theories that constitutes five main traits of human personality representing individual differences in cognition, emotion, and behavior: Openness to Experience, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. On the other hand, relational traits have also been linked with consistencies in social behavior and interaction patterns, with attachment theory [7] as the most emblematic theoretical framework in that respect [31, 43], capturing how individuals experience close relationships to and interactions with others.\\n\\nPersonality traits have been studied in the context of OSNs and the web overall, as findings show that they are strongly linked to OSN use [57], online friendships [60], and online reviews [52]. Moreover, certain prediction models have been proposed [37, 64] to extract users’ psychological background from their online behavioral residue and map it to personality characteristics. However, relational traits such as attachment orientations (AO) have been overlooked in online environments, even though user activity in OSNs heavily relates to social behavior characteristics. This makes the study of a relational profile critical from an application point of view and provides rich information about individuals’ social profile.\\n\\nThe present research aims to address this limitation in OSN research, by studying and predicting both relational traits and personality traits of users. The importance of relational facets of personality for explaining social interaction cannot be overstated. Given that online social media engagement resembles actual social interactions in many respects [15, 30], the need to study how different personality facets are reflected in online expression is particularly compelling. Attachment orientations, a key individual difference of relational orientation, can be derived on the basis of traces found in micro-blogs. Attachment orientations capture one’s notion of the self in relation to others and interpersonal relationships, with attachment theory being one of the key personality theoretical frames to explain actual social behavior [31]. Considering both traditional personality Big Five traits and relational traits is important for (1) providing holistic profiling of OSN users—humans have an integrated profile in which self and social aspects interrelate and affect each other, and joint profiling can be essential for understanding the overall human presence on OSNs; (2) uncovering more traits of people’s psychological and social world has been identified as a direction in OSN research (which currently focuses only on the personality traits) that could help to better explain, analyze, and predict online user behavior [66], e.g., with applications on customer segmentation [46] or digital advertisement environments [17]; and (3) shedding light on social interaction phenomena taking place in OSNs is of great socioeconomic importance, e.g., community formation [32], decision making [42], or information diffusion [12].\\n\\nTo this end, the present article proposes a novel data-driven approach to predict a holistic psychological profile of OSN users, capturing both their personality and relational traits.1 Building on insights stemming from psychology theory, our approach applies data mining on OSN textual and non-textual data, carefully selects different sets of features for predicting different types of traits, and exploits the inherent correlations in psychological traits, to efficiently predict a complete image of OSN users’ psychological profile. The proposed approach is applied on the Twitter micro-blogging service, which stands as a live, dynamic, and open OSN platform on which people intensively interact, and is largely driven by people’s spontaneous reactions and emotions expressing themselves (personality facet) and interacting with others (relational facet) at the same time.\\n\\nSpecifically, our contributions in detail are as follows:\\n\\nData mining and feature engineering for psychology traces in OSN. Motivated by psychology theory on personality suggesting that traits are reflected in different types of online behavior and actions, we identify a large set of features that capture language, behavioral, and emotional expressions of users in OSNs. The proposed feature engineering methodology accounts for a larger set of features than those considered in previous works, thus allowing to target more generic psychological profiling. To apply and test our methodology, we collected a labeled dataset: through a crowdsourcing platform, we recruited 243 individuals who consented to provide information about their psychology profiles. Subsequently, we compiled a ground-truth dataset labeled with their psychology profiles. We used the Twitter API to collect 350,000 tweets from the Twitter accounts of recruited participants and applied the proposed feature engineering methodology.\\n\\nHolistic psychological profiling. We propose a novel machine learning (ML) methodology to predict users’ holistic psychological profile including both Big Five personality and relational traits. The novelty of the proposed methodology is that it (1) uses a large set of the collected (psychological-related) features, (2) carefully selects the subsets of them with the strongest predictive power for each trait, and (3) exploits correlations between personality and relational (i.e., social) behavior traits to enhance individual trait predictions. In this way, our approach not only predicts social facets of a psychology profile (which is not captured by existing personality prediction models) along with personality facets but also leverages the different traits for more accurate holistic profile prediction.\\n\\nNew insights and improvement of prediction accuracy. Evaluating our methodology reveals interesting insights for the prediction of psychology traits from OSN traces: (1) using different sets of features performs better in predicting different psychological traits, (2) relational traits can be predicted as efficiently as personality traits, and (3) holistic personality prediction outperforms individual trait predicting models. We believe that our findings can pave the ground for future experimentation and studies in psychology profiling in OSNs. Moreover, the accuracy achieved by our approach (across all traits) is higher than current state-of-the-art approaches, which currently are limited to Big Five personality traits instead of relational traits. For example, applying the approach of [12] to our data provides a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.284, while our prediction model achieves a 29% improvement for personality traits (RMSE = 0.203) and has 32% better average performance when accounting for all traits (0.192 RMSE); this improvement comes as a result of using both a psychology-driven feature engineering methodology and a holistic profiling approach.\\n\\nPsychological profiling in the wild. We demonstrate the applicability of the proposed psychological profiling methodology through a use case. We identify a set of Twitter users who seem to be accepted as opinion leaders on social media (i.e., have a large following). We apply our methodology to predict their psychological profiles and analyze results. We find that the distributions of traits significantly deviates from regular users (defined as users included in our ground-truth dataset), and that the set of leaders can be clearly separated by only using their psychological profiles. These findings highlight the usefulness of our approach in the characterization of the personalities for different groups of OSN users (e.g., such a group psychological profile could be used to recommend skills/activities/jobs to users based on their profile similarity) and classification of users based on their profiles.\\n\\nIn this section, we provide an overview of related psychological literature, discuss related work, and highlight several open issues of existing methods. We also highlight the contribution of the present work. Section 3 details the collected dataset and the data mining and feature engineering methodology, and Section 4 presents the design and evaluation of the proposed machine learning predictive model. Finally, we conclude our article and discuss future work in Section 6.\\n\\nFirst, Please Summarize the paper in 10 points, in easy to read and understand simple English.\\nSecond, Explain what the paper does as if I'm 11 years old.\\n\\nThanks :))\",\n",

       " {'instruction': 'Here is Text 2: Communicating with External Audiences\\n\\nMany managers believe that they will never have to deal with the press. Often,\\nthey regard it with hostility. Most think press relations are entirely the domain\\nof their company’s or agency’s public relations department. But in fact, senior\\nexecutives say they spend more time on communications than on other tasks,\\nand a significant component of that time is devoted to press and public relations.\\nJunior managers need to be highly sensitive to press relations for the following\\nreasons:\\n• Often, free press can be the best way to acquaint the public with your product or service.\\nTo cite only one example, the amount Microsoft spent on advertising Windows\\n95 was dwarfed by the value of the free publicity it received from\\ninternational news coverage.\\n• Your particular area of expertise may unexpectedly become something your organization\\nneeds to promote or explain. Line workers at auto companies have been drafted\\nto extol quality improvements in advertisements; accountants may be called\\nto the CEO’s office for briefings on a potentially embarrassing news report or\\nan upcoming press conference.\\n• Public relations considerations need to be addressed at the beginning, not the end, of a\\nplanning process. Business history is replete with examples of companies that\\ninvested vast sums to develop products, ideas, or services that couldn’t be sold\\nbecause of public resistance to the concept, the configuration, or the public\\nimage of the company. General Motors’ Tacos, for example, could be the best\\nin the world and still not jump off the shelves.\\n• Junior managers become senior managers who will eventually have to deal with the\\npress directly. As both marketers and corporate citizens, organizations have to\\nexplain themselves to the public constantly through advertising, press releases,\\nand press conferences. Junior managers who understand this aspect of their\\nwork are likely to become senior managers faster. 1. A successful manager understands how the press works. Successful managers\\ntend to follow the press in general, and how their organization is playing in particular.\\nMembers of the press tend to trust companies and individuals with a\\ntrack record of accuracy and accessibility. To cite only two examples, both\\nJohnson & Johnson and Perrier survived charges of contaminated products because\\nthey had a record of reliability and accessibility and addressed the problems\\nimmediately. In both cases, and many others, stonewalling would have\\nbeen disastrous to the company’s image of wholesomeness and purity. Most\\npress stories last only a few days, but they can leave an indelible impression in\\nthe public’s mind. Many managers tend to believe they can “snow” the press\\nwith their greater expertise, but this strategy rarely works. Most reporters are\\nhard-working professionals who will carefully check out an expert assertion or\\nwho know someone who can.\\n2. A successful manager understands what the press needs. What the press needs\\nis a story, and bad news generally sells better than good news. Companies and\\nindividuals are most likely to have to deal with the press when something has\\ngone wrong. This suggests a couple of lessons. When you have good stories,\\ngive them to the press to establish a record of credibility; many media outlets\\nwill print or broadcast a press release from a reliable source more or less verbatim.\\nConsider how private decisions may look if they should become public.\\nIf something has gone wrong, take the initiative in announcing it, explaining it,\\nand telling the world how it’s going to be corrected.\\n3. A successful manager understands press jargon. Reputable reporters will\\nstick to their verbal agreements on how information you provide them is to\\nbe used. How you will be quoted depends on the ground rules you establish\\nat the beginning of an interview. Deep background means the reporter can\\nreflect the information in her story without possible attribution. Background\\nmeans that you can be referenced as “a reliable source.” Any other comment,\\nhowever apparently casual or social, can be quoted directly and\\nattributed.\\n4. A successful manager should be able to generate an attention-grabbing, accurate,\\nand well-constructed press release. While many managers may not be\\nregularly mailing out press releases themselves, most will be contributing to\\nthem and need to understand how they work. A good press release is extremely\\nformulaic and follows the structure of a good news story:\\na. The first paragraph states the main point clearly and emphasizes its newsworthiness.\\nFor example: “Acme Corporation announced today that it is\\nreleasing the best tire ever available on the world market.”\\nb. The second paragraph provides a quote from a reputable source: “Acme\\nPresident Rudy Roadrunner said, ‘Not only does this tire surpass all our\\ncompetitors’ in endurance, quality, and safety; it’s also available at a lower\\nprice.’ ”\\nc. The third paragraph provides evidence that the claims made so far are true:\\n“In repeated tests against our competitors . . . ”\\nd. The remaining paragraphs provide background information on the product, the\\ncompany, and Rudy Roadrunner, and they demonstrate a track record of credibility.\\nThey may also include testimonials available from respected independent\\nsources. Obviously, the formula of an effective press release will vary depending on\\nthe nature of the news to be announced. But the pyramid structure suggested by\\nthis example always applies: Move from the most important and specific to the\\nleast important and most general information. Busy editors often run a press release\\nmore or less verbatim and just cut it off when they run out of space. The\\neasier you make their jobs, the more likely they are to cover your story.\\nOnce you’ve written or contributed to a press release, decide who’s most\\nlikely to run it. This can cover the gamut from extremely specialized trade magazines\\nto the national or international media. Consider the use of venues other\\nthan print and broadcast media as well; perhaps there’s a room on the Internet\\nwhere interested parties are likely to gather.\\n5. A successful manager understands the role of the press in crisis management.\\nThis includes knowing how to provide effective interviews and\\nunderstanding when and how to hold a press conference. Certain rules\\napply to both:\\n\\nApplications\\na. Identify your central message, make sure you can back it up, and stick to it.\\nb. Prepare materials in advance—press releases, statements, supportive\\nstudies—that the reporters can take away with them and study or quote later.\\nc. Never say more than you know to be true. If you don’t know, say, “I don’t\\nhave that information at the moment, but I’ll get it to you as soon as I do”—\\nthen follow up.\\nd. Make sure your team is behind you. This means making sure not only that\\ntop management of a corporation agrees on a message, but also that other\\npotential press sources (for example, subordinate employees) have the same\\ninformation you’re dispensing to the public, believe it, and are unlikely to\\nleak contradictory and embarrassing information.\\ne. Provide the press with the most credible and informed access possible. Reporters\\nwill always want to get to the top. They’ll be more likely to cover\\nthe comments of a CEO or a Cabinet secretary than those of a press agent\\nor an underling. But they will understand that a high official may need to\\nrefer technical questions to an informed specialist.\\nf. Anticipate, and be prepared to respond to, the most difficult questions.\\ng. Don’t become hostile or defensive; experienced reporters are experts at\\nsmelling anxiety.\\nh. Make your answers brief, quotable, and to the point. Rambling and repetition\\nare likely to get you into trouble or open new lines of inquiry.\\ni. If you’re facing a problem you’ve caused, however inadvertently, be prepared\\nto acknowledge\\n\\nAre you ready for text 3?',\n",

       " {'instruction': 'Here is Text 3: Diversity and Intercultural Communication \\n\\nGenerally, the best answer to these questions is yes, but it always depends on the personal as well as the business aspects of your relationship. One good rule of thumb: When the other person gives\\nyou an opening, pursue it, and build on your mutual experience.\\nThis issue comes up even more in international communication. As companies\\nfrom manufacturers to media conglomerates become increasingly global, managers\\nneed to understand the norms of other cultures. Although English is on the verge of\\nbecoming the international language, standards of behavior and social interaction\\nvary greatly between the United States and England, let alone between, say, France\\nand Japan. In one country an invitation to dinner may be considered an expected\\npoliteness, while in another, it may be an invasion of a colleague’s private time.\\nAsking about someone’s family may be absolutely required in one culture and offensively\\nintrusive in another.\\nNo textbook can cover all such contingencies; one good rule if you’re not sure\\nmay be the trial lawyer’s: Don’t ask a question to which you don’t already know the\\nanswer. Another, and sometimes contradictory, rule is: Be frank about your cultural\\nconfusion. Your colleague likely will have been in the same situation himself and\\nwill be happy to help out. Finally, do your research; you’re likely to have a friend or\\ncoworker who knows the terrain better than you do. Our purpose here is to sensitize\\nmanagers to their increasing need to understand the norms of cultures other than\\ntheir own. (For a case addressing the special features of international communication,\\nsee International Oil later in this chapter.)\\nThe opportunities for cultural confusion—personal, commercial, ethical, and\\nlinguistic—are almost endless. Imagine marketing a Chevy Nova in Hispanic countries,\\nwhere “no va” means “it doesn’t run.” Many products that are perfectly safe to\\nmarket in first-world countries raise ethical problems when sold in developing\\ncountries—infant baby formula, for example, which if mixed with contaminated\\nwater can cause death. Working in other cultures means understanding your hosts’\\nconceptions of greetings, timing, hygiene, negotiation, agreement, politeness, personal\\nspace, gesture, meal etiquette, and closure.\\nWhile English has essentially become the international language, it’s important\\nto remember that there are many Englishes. A joke in one form of English can be a\\ndeadly insult in another. Although it may seem too obvious to emphasize, you must\\nunderstand the cultural norms and language use of people from other cultures before\\nyou can communicate effectively with them. This is true even if they are, say,\\nthe South American employees of your Canadian company. A bribe in one culture\\ncan be a thoughtful gift in another.\\nA recent article by Sydel Sokuvitz (Business Communication Quarterly, New\\nYork, March, 2002) suggests some principles for conducting successful intercultural\\nbusiness communication. Sokuvitz first describes the special challenges global\\nmanagers face, including:\\nCoping with a range of tensions that arise out of internationally dispersed activities,\\nThe challenges of maintaining coordinated activities across time-zones, cultural\\nboundaries, and different countries’ laws, and\\nThe difficulties posed when the right medium for your message in one culture\\nmay be wrong in another.\\nDrawing on a range of research in the field, Sokuvitz comes up with several\\nprovocative conclusions:\\nExcessive dependence on technological communication such as E-mail can result\\nin problems for both communication and productivity.\\nFace-to-face meetings with colleagues from other cultures are critical to achieving\\neffective communication.\\nStudying with students from other cultures is critical to preparing a manager\\nfor working in the increasingly globalized economy.\\nSokuvitz cites the following example from an article by Fernandez-Aroaz\\n(“Hiring without Firing,” Harvard Business Review, 1999):\\nA U.S.-based telecommunications company was seeking a CEO for its new division\\nin Latin America. An international search was conducted, and a veteran was\\nhired, someone known as an effective manager and marketing expert. “But his run\\nlasted less than a year and was nothing short of a disaster. The simple reason was\\nthat he lacked the two skills that the job really required: negotiation and cross-cultural\\nsensitivity.”\\nEventually the company was saved from near-bankruptcy by bringing in a\\nnew CEO who was a native Latin American with work experience in the U.S. His\\nability to bridge cultural differences is credited with saving the company.\\nCommunications between headquarters and subsidiaries is only one example\\nof the challenges posed by globalization. Companies in one country are under increasing\\nsocial pressure to take responsibility for the behavior of their subcontractors\\nin other countries. Recently, for example, Nike suffered adverse publicity because\\nof the work practices of shoe manufacturers it employs in Asia.\\nThe successful manager of the future increasingly will be required to be a citizen\\nof the world. While electronic communication may work fine for conveying information\\nor directions, there is no substitute for “speaking the language” of the\\npeople with whom you’re trying to communicate.\\n\\nAre you ready to answer some questions on text 1, text 2 and text 3?',\n",

Quantum mechanics is a branch of physics that deals with the behavior of very small particles, such as atoms and subatomic particles.\\n\\nIn a classical computer, information is processed using bits, which can represent either a 0 or a 1. Quantum computers, on the other hand, use quantum bits, or qubits, to store and process information. Qubits can represent both a 0 and a 1 simultaneously, a property known as superposition. This allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations much faster than classical computers.\\n\\nQuantum computers also have another quantum mechanical property called entanglement, which allows them to perform certain operations in parallel. This means that they can perform many calculations at the same time, further increasing their speed and power.\\n\\nQuantum computing is still a relatively new field and is not yet widely used.

It is a natural geological process that involves the erosion and transportation of sediment, which is then deposited in a new location, often forming layers of sedimentary rock over time.\\n\\nDeposition can occur through a variety of mechanisms, including gravity, wind, water, or ice. For example, sediment can be carried by a river and deposited at the river's mouth, forming a delta. Similarly, wind can transport sand and dust particles, which can settle on surfaces as dunes or dust deposits. Glaciers can also transport and deposit rocks and soil as they move.\\n\\nIn addition to geological processes, deposition can also occur in industrial and technological contexts. For example, in semiconductor manufacturing, deposition refers to the process of depositing thin films of material onto a substrate using techniques such as chemical vapor deposition or physical vapor deposition.\\n\\nOverall, deposition is an important natural and industrial process that helps shape our world and can have significant impacts on the environment and technological progress.\"},\n",

Arduino Uno adalah papan mikrokontroler yang populer yang dapat digunakan untuk mengendalikan berbagai perangkat elektronik. Dengan menggabungkan papan Arduino Uno dengan sensor kelembapan, Anda dapat membuat sistem penyiraman tanaman otomatis yang hanya akan menyiram tanaman ketika tanah cukup kering.\\n\\nSensor kelembapan yang digunakan dalam proyek ini dapat berupa DHT11 atau DHT22. Kedua sensor ini mengukur suhu dan kelembapan dan mengeluarkan sinyal digital yang dapat dibaca oleh Arduino Uno. Arduino Uno kemudian dapat menggunakan data ini untuk menentukan kapan tanah perlu disiram.\\n\\nPompa air adalah komponen penting lainnya dari sistem. Ini harus mampu menyediakan air yang cukup untuk tanaman tanpa terlalu banyak menyiram. Dalam desain ini, modul relay digunakan untuk mengendalikan pompa air. Modul relay terhubung ke Arduino Uno dan dapat dikendalikan oleh pin output digital. Ketika Arduino Uno mengirimkan sinyal ke modul relay, itu akan menyalakan pompa air.\\n\\nUntuk memastikan bahwa pompa air tidak rusak oleh back EMF, transistor digunakan untuk mengontrol operasinya. Transistor berfungsi sebagai saklar, memungkinkan Arduino Uno untuk menghidupkan atau mematikan pompa air. Dioda juga digunakan untuk melindungi transistor dari back EMF.\\n\\nKode untuk proyek ini melibatkan membaca data sensor kelembapan dan membandingkannya dengan nilai ambang batas. Jika tingkat kelembapan di bawah ambang batas, Arduino Uno akan mengirimkan sinyal ke modul relay, yang akan menyalakan pompa air.

       "  'output': \"The French Revolution, which lasted from 1789 to 1799, was one of the most significant events in modern history. It was a period of radical social and political upheaval in France that had far-reaching consequences, not only for the country but for Europe and the world as a whole. This essay will explore the causes, key events, and outcomes of the French Revolution.\\n\\nCauses of the French Revolution\\n\\nThe French Revolution was a response to the economic, social, and political problems that had been building in France for decades. One of the main causes of the revolution was the country's deepening financial crisis. The French government was heavily in debt due to the cost of the Seven Years' War and the American Revolution, and the burden of this debt fell on the common people in the form of heavy taxes.\\n\\nAnother significant cause of the French Revolution was the country's outdated feudal system. The nobility and clergy held vast amounts of power and wealth, while the majority of the population, the peasants and middle class, were oppressed and excluded from political decision-making.\\n\\nKey Events of the French Revolution\\n\\nThe French Revolution can be divided into three distinct phases. The first phase, which lasted from 1789 to 1792, was marked by the establishment of the National Assembly, the fall of the Bastille, and the adoption of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen.\\n\\nThe second phase, which lasted from 1792 to 1794, was characterized by the rise of the radical Jacobin faction, led by Maximilien Robespierre. During this phase, the king, Louis XVI, was executed, and a Reign of Terror ensued, during which thousands of people were executed for perceived counter-revolutionary activities.\\n\\nThe third phase, which lasted from 1794 to 1799, saw the fall of Robespierre and the rise of the Directory, a five-man governing body. During this phase, the French armies expanded their control over Europe, but the country continued to experience political instability and economic problems.\\n\\nOutcomes of the French Revolution\\n\\nThe French Revolution had a profound impact on France and the world. In France, the Revolution brought an end to the monarchy and the feudal system, established the principles of liberty, equality, and fraternity, and created a modern, secular state.\\n\\nThe Revolution also had far-reaching effects on Europe and the world. It inspired similar revolutions in other countries, such as the Haitian Revolution, and helped to spread democratic ideas and values across the globe.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe French Revolution was a complex and multifaceted event that had profound consequences for France and the world. It was a response to economic, social, and political problems that had been building in France for decades and was marked by key events such as the establishment of the National Assembly, the fall of the Bastille, the execution of Louis XVI, and the Reign of Terror.\\n\\nThe Revolution's outcomes included the establishment of a modern, secular state in France and the spread of democratic ideas and values across the globe. Despite the challenges and controversies of the Revolution, it remains an important chapter in the history of the modern world.\"},\n",
       " {'instruction': 'could you generate some discussion question?',\n",
       "  'output': 'Sure, here are more detailed explanations of points 3 and 4:\\n\\n3. Create a news report:\\nHave students create a news report or news program about the French Revolution. This can be done individually or in groups, depending on the size of the class. Students can research key events and figures of the Revolution, and then write and present their own news reports or programs as if they were journalists reporting on the events as they happened.\\n\\nThis activity can be adapted in various ways, such as having students focus on specific aspects of the Revolution, such as the Reign of Terror or the rise of Napoleon, or creating a modern-day news program that examines the ongoing impact of the French Revolution on contemporary society.\\n\\nBy creating a news report or program, students will not only develop research and writing skills, but they will also gain a deeper understanding of the events of the French Revolution and how they continue to shape the world today.\\n\\n4. Debate key issues:\\nAnother engaging way to teach the French Revolution is to have students participate in debates about key issues related to the Revolution. This can be done as a class or in smaller groups, and can cover a range of topics, such as the role of the monarchy, the effectiveness of the Reign of Terror, or the significance of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen.\\n\\nDebating key issues allows students to think critically about the events and ideas of the Revolution, as well as practice their public speaking and argumentation skills. It also allows students to gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and controversies of the Revolution, and encourages them to develop their own perspectives and opinions on the subject.\\n\\nTeachers can structure debates in different ways, such as assigning roles to students and having them argue from different perspectives, or encouraging students to develop their own arguments based on research and analysis. By engaging students in debates, they will be more likely to remember key events and concepts related to the French Revolution, as well as develop important critical thinking and communication skills.'},\n",

       " {'instruction': 'the solenoids will be 12v so they will have to be controled by relays triggered by the GPIO pins',\n",
       "  'output': \"That's correct! To control 12V solenoids with the Raspberry Pi, you will need to use relay modules that are compatible with the Pi's GPIO pins.\\n\\nRelay modules allow you to use a low-voltage signal (in this case, from the Pi's GPIO pins) to control a high-voltage circuit (the 12V solenoids). The relay acts like a switch that is controlled by the Pi's GPIO pins. When the GPIO pin is set to HIGH, the relay is closed and the solenoid is turned on, and when the GPIO pin is set to LOW, the relay is opened and the solenoid is turned off.\\n\\nHere's an example of how to connect a relay module to the Raspberry Pi and control a solenoid:\\n\\n1. Connect the relay module to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins. The exact wiring will depend on the specific relay module you are using, so be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions. In general, you will need to connect the relay module's VCC and GND pins to the Pi's 5V and GND pins, and connect the relay module's IN pin to a GPIO pin on the Pi.\\n2. Connect the solenoid to the relay module. Again, the exact wiring will depend on the specific components you are using. Typically, you will connect one end of the solenoid to the relay module's NO (Normally Open) pin and the other end to the relay module's COM (Common) pin. When the relay is closed, the circuit is completed and the solenoid is turned on.\\n3. Write a Python program that uses the RPi.GPIO library to control the GPIO pins and turn the solenoids on and off through the relay modules. The exact code will depend on your specific setup and timed sequence requirements, but here's an example of how to turn a single solenoid on and off:\\n```python\\nimport RPi.GPIO as GPIO\\nimport time\\n\\n# Set up GPIO pins\\nGPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)\\nGPIO.setup(relay_pin, GPIO.OUT)\\n\\n# Turn solenoid on\\nGPIO.output(relay_pin, GPIO.HIGH)\\ntime.sleep(on_time)\\n\\n# Turn solenoid off\\nGPIO.output(relay_pin, GPIO.LOW)\\ntime.sleep(off_time)\\n\\n# Clean up GPIO pins\\nGPIO.cleanup()\\n```\\n4. Modify the Python program to control multiple solenoids in a timed sequence. You can use the same basic logic as the example above, but you will need to add additional relay modules and GPIO pins for each solenoid.\\n5. Add a feature to the GUI that allows you to set the time for each solenoid in the sequence.\\n6. Test the entire system to ensure that the timed sequence and relay control are working correctly. Make sure to test the system under a variety of operating conditions to ensure reliability.\\n\\nWith these additional steps, you will have a control module that can control 12V solenoids using relay modules that are triggered by the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.\"},\n",

       "  'output': \"The importance of higher education cannot be overstated in today's society. While a high school diploma used to be sufficient for many jobs, the reality is that employers are now seeking candidates with advanced degrees and specialized skills. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons why higher education is necessary for success in today's economy.\\n\\nFirstly, higher education provides individuals with the knowledge and skills necessary to compete in today's job market. Many professions require advanced degrees, such as law, medicine, and engineering. Even in fields where a degree is not required, having one can give job seekers an edge over the competition. In addition to providing specialized knowledge, higher education also teaches critical thinking and problem-solving skills, which are highly valued by employers.\\n\\nSecondly, higher education is essential for personal growth and development. College and university campuses provide students with opportunities to explore their interests, develop new skills, and form lifelong connections with peers and mentors. Students are exposed to a diverse range of ideas, cultures, and perspectives, which can broaden their understanding of the world and help them become more empathetic and open-minded individuals.\\n\\nFinally, higher education is critical for economic growth and development. In today's knowledge-based economy, innovation and technological advancements are the key drivers of growth. Higher education institutions are hubs for research and development, and they play a critical role in fostering innovation and driving economic progress. By investing in higher education, governments can create a highly skilled workforce and attract businesses and industries that require specialized talent.\\n\\nIn conclusion, higher education is essential for success in today's society. It provides individuals with the knowledge, skills, and connections necessary to compete in the job market and contribute to economic growth and development. While the cost of higher education can be a barrier for many, there are options available, such as scholarships, grants, and student loans, to help make it more accessible. As a society, we must continue to invest in higher education to ensure that we remain competitive and continue to drive progress in the years to come.\"},\n",

It didn\\'t help that my dad had to close down his retail stores in the city due to the pandemic. We created two new companies that year. Due to our financial situation, my family had decided to move to Texas from New York; this would be our fifth home since I was born. We understood what this called for, but packing and unpacking are still highly time-consuming, taking away from the limited time we had.\\n\\nMy side business of buying and selling sought-after sneakers using automation software was also taking off at the time, so I would manage that simultaneously. I did my best to focus in class, but I admit I often worked or packed while I should\\'ve been paying attention in class.\\n\\nMoving came with a whole new school where I couldn\\'t choose my classes because I was enrolled late and wasn\\'t even able to meet with my counselor due to covid restrictions. I juggled online classes and started new businesses back up with my dad. Covid-19 entirely shifted the way we lived from our environment and stress levels to our friends, or the lack thereof.\\n\\n--\\n\\nAdditional Info\\n\\nMany times during the last two years, I\\'ve sacrificed my focus on education to prioritize family. I\\'ve never concentrated less on school than in 2021, my junior year and a time when I was supposed to be applying for college. \\n\\nMy mother was expecting my baby brother. My grandparents had just come to live with us. My elder sister was in the hospital undergoing chemotherapy as she had been diagnosed with lymphoma in March of 2021. My dad had been searching for work and found a restaurant space he would start leasing the same month of my sister\\'s diagnosis. As the old saying goes, when it rains, it pours. \\n\\nMy typical day would consist of taking online classes while replying to customers of my e-commerce business and designing content or adjusting the website for my dad\\'s restaurant. During the lunch break, I would pack orders, prepare them to ship out, and then have my actual lunch during my next class. After classes ended around 4:30, I\\'d go to the hospital to check up on my sister before rushing back home to get ready to work at the restaurant until eleven at night. My grandfather, who has Parkinson\\'s and suffers from dementia, routinely forgets where he is and runs out of the house. Since my mom could not run after him, every few days, we\\'d have to come back early and try to find him walking through an empty street at night. \\n\\nObviously, this schedule left no time for studying and sometimes not even for homework. I remember staying up until 1 or 2 am after getting back to finish AP US History assignments. Since it was so impossible to retain information in class, I\\'d decided not to take the SAT and even skip one of three of my AP tests. I worked late nights the entire month of May, and the one day I missed work because I had an AP test in the morning was a disaster at the restaurant. \\n\\nSince I was little, I\\'ve been a straight A\\'s, school-first student. Unfortunately, it became challenging to keep up with this mindset, but I\\'m happy that I learned through the obstacles and, as a result, became a more rigid and more well-rounded individual. \\n\\n--\\n\\nSMU Application:\\nSMU appeals to students for a variety of reasons. Briefly describe why you are interested in attending SMU and what specific factors have led you to apply. (250-word limit)\\\\*\\n\\nSMU defines my intersection of interests and morals. \\n \\nOne aspect that stands out is that the Cox School of Business teachers have real-world experience in the industry. An opportunity to pick their brains and bounce ideas off my professors would greatly benefit me; experience stands as the best teacher. The University also puts an emphasis on diversity and pledges that \"Every Mustang Will Be Valued.\" Playing into that, the SMU Muslim Student Association has made efforts in raising charity for local refugees, something I can easily contribute to, given my background in the field. \\n \\nIt\\'s also easy to start a new student organization not already present on campus. One of my first goals would be to create a blockchain club to explore the future of the Web3 movement with my peers. The Mustangs have also partnered with the NFTU program, showing the University is open to blockchain technology. A growth environment is\\n\\nMy sister, who attends Boston College, recommends finding a school with a college culture I\\'ll remember. With SMU, I get the best of both worlds, a distinct, social culture while staying close to home. Recently, I met a professor at SMU at a community service event I took part in. She encouraged me to apply and check out the campus. When I visited, there was a college football game that night, and I got to see the enthusiasm in the community—a sense of livelihood I have missed since moving from New York. \\nSMU is a diverse learning environment shaped by the convergence of ideas and cultures. How will your unique experiences or background enhance the University, and how will you benefit from this community? (250-word limit)\\\\*\\nI bring my passions, culture, and experiences to SMU. Sharing my journey with those around me and hearing theirs. Engaging in deep conversations about culture, religion, and ethics is nothing new to me and serves as an example to learn from. \\n \\nThe best way to gain wisdom is from people and the environment. Being a Pakistani who comes from a background valuing family above all, I\\'ve gotten the chance to learn from the extraordinary journeys of the many who\\'ve made the voyage to America. These are my favorite stories to hear, some came to the country with little money, and even less formal education yet were successful in their endeavors through hard work and determination. \\n \\nAn advantage I think about frequently is the exposure to various personalities as a teenager in the city of New York. Absorbing diverse concepts and ideals serves as a leg up on the majority that hasn\\'t. Our backgrounds mold us into who we are. Moving five houses in less than 15 years doesn\\'t sound ideal, but it made me who I am today, and looking back, I\\'m thankful for the situation it has put me in. \\n \\nI aim to continue discovering new personalities at SMU. There are numerous stories of people finding a founding team for their business by networking at their University. I\\'m hoping to accomplish the same, surrounding myself with people who can teach me concepts I\\'m unfamiliar with and vice-versa. Ideas build on each other, and that\\'s how we change the world.\\n--\\nDMHP: Write a letter to your future self:\\n\\nHello Zuhair,\\n\\nI\\'m writing this letter in 2022, just a day before our 18th birthday. Just two days ago, I attended Converge22 in San Francisco with Spawn, and I\\'m now trying to catch up on all the work I missed while I was away. My current stresses will probably seem minor to you now, but I need to figure out how to do my Calculus homework by tomorrow, and my group for the Comets to the Core presentation didn\\'t even start on our slides yet.\\n\\nIn my list of long-term goals, I have two specific ones that I\\'m currently working on. The first is to start working out regularly, and the second is to learn how to code. For the last two weeks, I have been waking up around 6:30 to go to the gym, and my days have been feeling a lot more productive. At Converge, many people I met recommended I pick up a coding language as a technical skill to back up my design expertise and my interest in technology. I\\'m trying to learn javascript, and hopefully, by the time you\\'re reading this, I\\'m familiar with multiple programming languages. I think it would be a huge unlock for me to add to my knowledge and build upon, mainly because I\\'ve been experimenting with programs since a young age.\\n\\nYou have a lot on your hands right now, namely, doing marketing for Spawn and now the UTD Investments Club. E-commerce is also doing reasonably well, but, especially in the holiday season, I just don\\'t have enough hours in the day to concentrate on everything at total capacity. This week I\\'ve had to be on so many zoom calls while we put in proposals for sponsorships at Spawn.\\n\\nAnyway, I hope all is well. Whatever you do, take care of your health and spend time with family.\\n\\nWishing you the best - Zuhair, 2022\\nTell us about a community or group to which you belong. How have you contributed to this group, and how has it benefitted you?\\n\\nI owe a lot of my accomplishments to my community, without which I wouldn\\'t merely be the person I am today. Back in New York, my family played a significant role in MANA (Memon Association of North America); this group of Memons --a minority Muslim ethnic group originating from Indian and Pakistani heritage. MANA aimed to remind community members of their South Asian roots and keep a close-knit group of familiar faces.\\n\\nFor my parents, when they first moved, these were the only people they interacted with outside of work. In a place like New York, it\\'s easy to get lost in fast-paced city life and forget where you come from. Memons are known for being merchants back in South Asia, so naturally, many community members also used the gatherings to network and help each other with the business and find partners for their children. \\n\\nEveryone starts somewhere, and for graphic design, MANA was looking for someone to design a flyer for a sports event. My dad told me I should do it, but I had no idea where to begin. I used web-based software and would screenshot the result. Looking back now, using several different fonts and colors is not as artistic as it seemed back then, but every time I look back, I see progress. \\n\\nMANA got me started with graphic design, and I still use the skills I first learned today; I went from picking random website templates to making my own using Adobe Illustrator and now Figma. Just this week, I am wrapping up two freelance projects for restaurants that hired me to design their logo, menu, and promotional content, and it all started by volunteering to make a cricket event graphic. My interest in design has even brought me to web design and app design, I\\'ve started experimenting with UI, and I trust I\\'ll make the journey just like I did with flyer design. \\n\\nI continue to make flyers for MANA even after moving to Dallas. I owe them everything I\\'ve achieved in the design space and even business-wise. I\\'ve met my best friends by going to the event and still talk to them over discord, we\\'re all similar in our business-mindedness, and there\\'s no doubt the community helped shape that.\\n--\\nWhether it is graphic design, business ideas, or even thinking up games to play with my cousins, I have always found ways to incorporate my concepts to improve what I\\'m doing. I have been writing theories in a book since I was 12 years old, including developing electric cars and blockchain technology to stop corrupt government practices. Sometimes I will take breaks just to imagine the future of our existence, our roadblocks, and our objectives for a better life. In doing so, I idealize business paths for my future that solve said problems using technology. Automation has also been a focal point for me as I am interested in problem-solving and keep an open mind to upcoming innovations.\\n\\nI started in graphic design in 2016, and it has taken a significant portion of my time over the years. I visualize my ideas through digital work and incorporate my business sense to market products. I\\'ve learned Adobe Illustrator, Photoshop, Lightroom, Final Cut Pro X, and Figma, all for this purpose. Today I have designed branding language for several successful companies and continue to use digital media to my strength. My campaigns tend to go outside of the box, resulting in higher click rates due to the creative nature of the advertisements.\\n\\n\\nThey say, \"Curiosity killed the cat,\" but most don\\'t know the end of the idiom: \"and satisfaction brought it back.\" Satisfaction eluding to the reward that one feels once they finally find the answer they were looking for. My curiosity works similarly, sometimes not allowing me to finish my work until I have found what I am searching for, even if it may seem irrelevant at the time. I often fight with myself for needing to know how everything works; However, the pleasure it brings once I figure it out has me outweighing the cost with the benefits. \\n\\nThe aspect of curiosity plays into my perfectionist persona. Everything must be top-notch, or I am left with the guilt of knowing I could have done better given a bit more time down the eternal rabbit hole. The price of curiosity does not come without its compensation, though; I believe if there is interest in a subject long enough, one will eventually become a beneficiary after investing their time and/or knowledge into a concept. \\n\\nMy curiosity ranges a broad spectrum with a passion for blockchain technology, efficient marketing strategy, and human psychology, to name a few. Given a chance, I will always investigate and ask questions about a field or idea that piques my interest, and once I start, there is no end in sight. Therefore the \"satisfaction\" is produced when I reach a milestone in the long journey.\\n\\nSelf-motivation is a concept most struggle with, though I think this is the most effective type of motive. This determination has brought itself to light in my life in various ways. Tying into the endless curiosity point, my character does not rest until I believe I have achieved the highest quality given my resources. There is always somewhere I can improve. No matter how hard I\\'ve worked, if the next day was not better than the last, then I am still failing. \\n\\nWhile I know it is impossible to reach perfection, this does not stop me from trying. I have an infinite amount of problems to solve and concepts to learn with less time every day, so I know if I stop pushing boundaries, they will push me.\\n\\nResiliency has played a factor in my school life where an \\'A\\' could always become an \\'A+,\\' and my presentations would take hours because the design and transitions had to be flawless. In business, I set goals for myself at 15 years old, much higher than I expected, only to hit them in a few months. A big part of that comes from the nature of my family; we\\'ve seen ups and downs, making us immune to the worst of times and cautious at the height. My mother always says, \"compare yourself only to who you were yesterday,\" meaning if I am not improving every day, I am falling behind. \\n\\nAt Syosset High School: \\nDuring my time at Syosset High School, I could not become an officer of a club because of grade requirements. However, I did help out in the Investment club by raising funds after school, selling pizza. In the Entrepreneurship club, by getting four of my friends to join the club where we would meet with successful business people. \\n\\nAt Independence High School:\\nWhile my time in-person at the school has been short, I have already reached out and met with the board of the National Honors Society board and am helping them create and logo for this year\\'s merchandise using my graphic design knowledge. I enjoy this type of work as it helps me gain experience while also helping the community.\\n\\nElaborate on what you would like the college admission committee to know about you regarding personal qualities, unusual talents, academic strengths, community activities, etc\\n\\nMy university should know my story, the building blocks to who I am today. Having moved five homes, I have gotten a diverse look into the lives of others. Due to this, I can easily empathize with the challenges people face. In addition, I problem solve quicker than most after being exposed to multiple ways of doing a task. While a nomadic life may look stressful to most, it plays an advantage in developing my social consciousness. \\n\\nThe exposure has allowed me to contribute to community efforts, such as creating a fundraiser to supply food and essentials to those suffering in the COVID-19 pandemic in New York. My friends and I arranged boxes and negotiated with retailers to provide cost-effective supplies to give out. We utilized Facebook to search for those who needed help most at the time—sometimes driving to Brooklyn, an hour drive from Long Island, just to deliver a box of food to a woman who just lost her job due to the circumstances. \\n\\nThen a monumental shift when my family moved to Dallas, but it was easy for me; I knew what had to be done and how to adapt. I was a pro at this point. Moving multiple times has allowed me to grasp a comprehensive view of the world and prepared me to adjust to my environment in the future. \\n\\nSome talents are genetic or even innate. Marketing represents this quality for me. It just seems right to me. Ever since I was young, I have been able to sell anything. At six years old, I traded my pokemon cards and snacks for what I thought was the better share of the deal. Today I run an e-commerce business selling electronics and apparel nationwide. It\\'s just in my genes; it seems native. \\nWhat do you consider to be your most important activity/(ies) outside of school? You may include jobs, religious activities, hobbies, and special talents. Why are these important to you? \\n\\nExperience came in many fields for me, mainly in the last two years of my life. In 2016 I volunteered to do graphic design and photography for a local community my family was involved in. Their goal was to involve more youth members using digital media. \\n\\nThe only problem was, I had no prior experience. I used web-based programs for the flyer designs, and I would use my sister\\'s Nikon camera to shoot pictures for the photography. Later on, I\\'d go on to explore the depths of how I can use digital media.2 I learned photography, video editing, and some graphic design in just a couple of weeks. I was eager to learn, and designing seemed to come easily with my interest in tech. \\n\\nLittle did I know this volunteering changed everything for me. It took years to grasp some design and video editing concepts, many of which I don\\'t even know today, but most beneficial was the start. A few years later, I was hired for some baking company to make Instagram posts. I would charge $20 for each. Looking back at it, I realize my prices were extremely low for the quality of work. \\n\\nDuring the same time, my friend had told me about the profitable business of reselling sneakers. I tried that and started using my graphic design experience to create high-ranking eBay listings for what I was selling. I didn\\'t think much of it for some time...\\n\\nThen the world was hit with the COVID-19 pandemic. I started to help my dad shift his business because his sole source of income, physical cell phone stores, had to be shut down due to the state mandate. My dad and I would build a wholesale brand in March of 2020 to make an income. I would also explore resale opportunities on the side, separately, that I would start saving up and investing in. From some birthday money I was saving up for three years, I had managed to buy shoes, toys, and other limited, high-profit items. \\n\\nWhen we moved to Texas, I had some capital left after liquidating my small stock in New York. I made choices based on what we learned in class, and I would buy popular children\\'s toys and games to prepare for the holiday season when supply would be low, but demand would skyrocket. The market was low on stock due to shipping difficulties regarding the pandemic, increasing the already high holiday premiums leading to my first 1,000 orders, all while attending virtual classes from my laptop. I would write my essays early in the morning to have enough time to package shipments for the afternoon. \\n\\n\\nWhich high school teacher/class has impacted you most, and why/how?\\n\\nIn 10th grade, I took a College Marketing Class; this would be my first College Level course, earning me six credits by the end of the school year. The class would serve my interests and introduce new strategies to me. \\n\\nThrough the course, I gained the opportunity to be selected for a marketing and design competition—a perfect blend of my skills. We were posed with creating a logo and rebranding strategy for an old Italian restaurant looking to open itself up to a younger crowd. Using my graphic design experience and my newly found marketing strategies, I worked a month on the poster board and elements to present. I would stay after school and come early to create what I thought was my best work at the time. \\n\\nI ended up getting 2nd place out of the 32 contestants that day. The only weakness in my display was my presenting skills; I had focused too much on the graphics and board aesthetics that I forgot to review the delivery. I\\'d be super observant in class for the rest of the course to up my presentation ability. I felt so defeated that I watched hours of presenters on YouTube for the next few months. I\\'ve watched TED Talks on every topic. Today, I am a confident presenter and can establish my presence acting as a magnet to watch and absorb.\\n\\nIn what ways are you more prepared to live independently than you were two years ago?\\n\\nFor most of last year, I already felt I was living independently. My sister was home from Boston College after getting diagnosed with Leukemia. My mother was expecting my younger brother. Meanwhile, my dad would search for work, and my little sister would be in school until 3:30. With my virtual classes in session, I would be responsible for making my meals and making enough for my mom and sisters. I realized afterward that the experience helped a lot with my time management skills, even experimenting by getting up earlier to give myself a head start on the day. I downloaded the Walmart+ app, so instead of going to the grocery store when my mom wasn\\'t feeling well, we could just order groceries digitally, saving a lot of time and energy.\\n\\nWhat do you hope to accomplish in the future? What are your post-graduate plans?\\n\\nHave you ever heard of the \\'Zone of Genius\\'? Gay Hendricks wrote about the concept in his book The Big Leap. Simply put, it is the point where all your skills and your \\'innate genius\\' meet. The zone is what is most seems most effortless for you and difficult for the majority. To bring it to its potential, we must practice our natural talent and blend it with our passions. For me, that is Graphic Design and Marketing paired with my interest in blockchain technology. Along with some friends, I have already started building a project utilizing the technology, and I have so many ideas on how to implement it into everyone\\'s daily life. \\n\\nBlockchain is my future because it is ultimately humanity\\'s future. The technology is our only hope to introduce a transparent commerce system when the people in power prefer to hide their shady dealings. It solves the problem of corruption and resolves some of the power of giant corporations. Blockchain technology can\\'t be stopped, and nor can I.\\n\\nThe only thing I know for certain is that blockchain will be involved in my future; the rest is flexible. Given the adaptable nature I eluded earlier, I am willing to go where life takes me. \\n\\nWhat other information would be helpful for your counselor to know? Difficulties overcome, struggles, mitigating circumstances, passions... Be sure to mention if you moved to our school during HS, if you have a disability, or if anything else has impacted your GPA. \\n\\nMy GPA would look better if I did not engage in multiple out-of-school activities last year. I would work on my e-commerce business for a significant portion of the day, leaving less time for school work and studying. The only day I took off was the day of my AP test. Had I portioned the time out for studying instead of working, I would see the results in my favor. However, I decided on my future as I believe the experience I gained combats a few percentage points. \\n\\nThe same goes for my SAT, I probably should have studied when I was working, but I did not. I took my first SAT this year with no PSAT before. Decisions were made; I can\\'t tell if they were good ones until the future.\\n\\nAs for my Freshman and Sophomore grades, I am pretty satisfied knowing the rigorous courses offered there. I never missed honor roll any quarter, and knowing how competitive the school was, it felt like an outstanding achievement. The classes were challenging, and I knew no one with a perfect GPA there. \\n\\nHowever, I learned that Frisco School District often allows retests on every exam until a student reaches 100% and uses other tactics such as \\'waterfalling\\' to ensure no student fails. Therefore my GPA will be lower than most of the others because my former school did not allow such practices. Although this is the case, I won\\'t let it worry me as it will push me harder to come out on top.',\n",

Complete my questionnaire for a free e-mail consultation.\\n\\nAdmitted McCombs School of Business Transfer 3.8 GPA\\nI stood still, lost amidst a sea of towering figures. I felt the familiarity of being alone. Each time I change environments, it doesn’t come any easier. A broad-shouldered girl in a blue shirt asked accusingly me where I needed to be. Despite intimidating me at first, she turned out to be sweet and concerned for my well-being. \\n\\nShe took me to my classroom and introduced me to the other girls. They all seemed so different from me. My family left the United States when I was young, and during my ten years spent in India, I switched between three very different schools.\\n\\nAccustomed to American schools that are relatively orderly and organized, it took time to adjust to India’s disorderly schools. Just as I started feeling comfortable with the unusual teaching methods of my new school, my parents transferred me to a more “cultural” school. With a total of seven students in the entire school, we learned in literal shacks. \\n\\nMy classmates were behind in their education and far below my grade level, so the teachers focused most of their time on them. I suffered greatly when I switched back into mainstream schooling. Now, it was my classmates who raced through their work. I was thrown, unprepared, into India’s rigorous education system. I struggled with constructing angles and balancing chemical equations. I had to work especially hard to make up for the time lost at my cultural school. \\n\\nI made it through Tenth grade with extensive additional coaching. Despite my setback, I knew that I could do better. Through my classes, I began to develop an interest with the mathematical functions that power finance and accounting. My accounting teacher became my biggest inspiration. The way she related accounting procedures to current business crises convinced me to learn more. I started keeping up with companies’ corporate strategies and their effect on the economy. \\n\\nBefore my board exams, I completed additional work on my own and solved about 70 papers in preparation. The work ethic I acquired under her guidance is something that has stuck to me through the challenging times at community college. I continue to self-study with online courses offered on Khan Academy to further exceed expectations.\\n\\nAdditionally, my internship at the Pratham International School in the summer of 2016 gave me real-world experience with auditing and organizing financials. I applied my classroom and self-studying knowledge to help with vendor payment methods and profitable tuition pricing. \\n\\nI also pursued an internship in the accounting department of The Home Depot. For the first time, I saw theoretical concepts come to life as I helped facilitate vendor payment methods and profitable product pricing. The chance to interact with higher level financial managers gave me exposure to strategic decision making and contingency planning. \\n\\nI look forward to pursuing another internship and taking advantage of the connections provided by the McCombs School of Business. I hope the university will help connect me with fruitful opportunities to develop my business competencies. By participating in the Texas Stock Team and The University Finance Association, I can explore different interests and develop my network. I don’t have these opportunities at Houston Community College, and I don’t think any Texas university offers the unparalleled opportunities of UT. Doing research under award winning professors like Laura Starks and Robert Parrino will give me a head start in the industry. \\n\\nLike The University of Texas, I also want to transform myself and change the world. The past few months at the Houston community college have helped me realize that I need an environment with a limitless ceiling for growth. Since I have experienced many different educational environments, I have a good idea for what I seek while avoiding opportunities that may not be in my best interest. I bring a different perspective that will contribute to classroom discussions and be a valued addition to the McCombs community.\\n\\nCommentary\\nI clearly remember this student’s dramatic admissions decision. UT actually released almost all of their rejections and acceptances by early June, yet this applicant didn’t hear back until a week later. \\n\\nWe both assumed that wasn’t good news, but we were pleasantly surprised that they received a last minute acceptance into the McCombs School of Business. I have no doubt that their Essay A Statement of Purpose and resume tipped the scales in their favor despite their below average GPA.\\n\\nThey cover a lot of territory discussing being raised in two different countries and attending three different schools with radically different environments before transitioning back to Texas and attending HCC. They touch on independent studies and a relevant internship that informs their prospective major and career goals.\\n\\nThey also do a nice job of describing how their current college has a low ceiling and will not allow them to achieve their long-term goals. They’ve done their homework by supplying a few informative “Why UT” statements concerning student organizations and professors to help reviewers imagine how this student might contribute to the Forty Acres.\\n\\nThroughout, they argue convincingly that they know where they want to go, how they bring diverse perspectives to campus, and why UT is their best fit university.\\n\\nCheck out my new book Surviving the College Admissions Madness and Youtube Channel\\n\\nFour-Year Liberal Arts Admit 4.0 GPA\\nMy decision to enroll at the University of North Texas was ill–informed. Initially, I believed that, far enough away from my family yet close enough to return home every few weeks, I could grow on my terms. This unfortunate decision was fostered by my perspective of academic environments and the “college life.” I believed a university education was something purely academic, never multifaceted. \\n\\nAs someone who has never considered myself particularly school–spirited, I did not feel the need to be connected to any larger community. I viewed my transition to college simply as a stepping stone to the next chapter of my life, a means to an end and not something inherently valuable. \\n\\nI chose UNT by process of elimination. I wanted to attend a Texas public university, but not as close as San Marcos and Austin or even College Station or Houston. However, the more time I spent in Denton, the more I realized that there was a low ceiling for my potential to grow. I felt like a “big fish in a small pond” and my development, both intellectual and social, stalled. \\n\\nI have always aspired to something greater, something more challenging, something different. These aspirations, unfortunately, were not able to be experienced at UNT. My courses were stagnant, easy, “go with the flow”––the exact opposite of what I needed. Most students around me, even those within the Honors College, did not study for major exams or complete their assignments on time. It made me restless and uneasy. \\n\\nAs time wore on, I concluded I was not finding the challenges I originally sought. I refused to settle into the mediocre routines around me and merely coast along with strong, yet hollow grades. The more I considered and explored my academic goals and future, the clearer it became that only the University of Texas offers the rigor and challenge that I seek. \\n\\nThis fall, I visited the 40 Acres and immediately noticed a striking difference. Nearly every other student I came across wore burnt orange; people walked confidently and actually socialized on campus. There seemed to be a school spirit that was conspicuously absent at UNT. The University of Texas felt like a family, a cohesive yet still fiercely individualistic unit. Even with a just a two–hour visit to the 40 Acres, I could already feel its infectious energy creeping up inside me, a feeling I would not soon forget.\\n\\nI had not considered that a university experience could be both academically enriching and spiritually fulfilling. Instantly, I knew where I needed to call home. My fascination and excitement was furthered with the University of Texas when I researched the Anthropology Department. I was amazed at the never–ending opportunities for research. For example, Dr. Courtney Handman’s focus on linguistic anthropology and her examination of recently–converted Protestant indigenous communities in rural Papua New Guinea related to my interests of languages, religion, and their convergence.\\n\\nMy passion with linguistic anthropology began when I was nine years old when my parents took me on my first international trip. We traveled throughout Italy, Switzerland, France, Spain, Sicilia, and Croatia. With each country, there was an entire new method of communication, an entirely new way of life. \\n\\nExposure to different cultures and languages, however, was not an entirely new concept. I live in a bilingual home. My father grew up in Madrid and learned both Spanish and English. My father wanted to share a vital part of his identity and childhood with me, and we communicate primarily in Spanish. Later, I became unsatisfied with only speaking two languages, and self–studied French. \\n\\nBy the time I entered high school, I could converse fluently with both my French and Spanish teachers. These experiences continue to shape and inform my desire to balance the arts and sciences by studying linguistic anthropology before enrolling in medical school.\\u2003\\n\\nCommentary\\nSince they are applying to a non-STEM program with a 4.0, it isn’t necessary for this applicant to discuss their grades or relevant coursework. Despite having a high chance of gaining admission based on their grades, they leave little room for doubt by submitting a thoughtful essay that describes honestly their decision to attend UNT and why that isn’t working out.\\n\\nIt’s a balanced essay that focuses equally on where they’re coming from and how UT can help them explore their interests and achieve their long-term goals. Any time a transfer applicant is coming from a four-year university, its important to discuss tastefully why they don’t feel their current university is a good fit. We worked for a while on striking the right tone.\\n\\nTo discuss why UT is a great fit and why you want to transfer often requires developing why you’re currently dissatisfied. Their reviewer can no doubt relate to their story of not knowing what they want as a high school student and how attending college gives them an idea of what they don’t prefer moving forward.\\n\\nUT has extensive study abroad and language programs, and they develop well how UT offers resources not accessible at any other public university. They demonstrate how their current studies and travels abroad inform them that although they want to change universities, they want to continue majoring in Anthropology.\\n\\nInterested in working together?

It took three minutes to arrive at the base of the towering skyscraper. I sighed, disappointed, and accepted this final defeat to cap a dispiriting senior year as I nervously navigated through the downtown underground labyrinth.\\n\\nLike many of my classmates, I spent most of my high school years working tirelessly in hopes of attending a prestigious university. With each rejection letter, I wasn’t sure any university would admit me. Receiving CAP stung particularly. I questioned the point of studying so long for my SAT and ACT and taking a few AP courses that didn’t particularly interest me. Reluctantly, I submitted the deposit to my safety school. \\n\\nI walked to my car that day feeling like I've lost before I even started. Even getting to my interview proved frustrating. I had never visited downtown Houston. Battling traffic and tricky one-ways, I found the parking garage, slid into a space without bumping my neighbors and stumbled through the building before finding the first set of elevators, “Sky Lobby.” I boarded. A man in his forties joined followed quickly by a college-aged student. More men and women filed in until we crunched together shoulder-to-shoulder.\\n\\nI felt out of place, and dad’s suit didn’t fit right - sleeves too long and shoulder pads jutting below my neck. Everyone appeared so confident. People talked over one another as they discussed seemingly important things like upcoming meetings and lunch plans. Noises blended, a hum of indistinct chatter. After three deafening minutes of chit-chat, a merciful ding signaled our arrival. The doors glided inwards.\\n\\nA nervous silence preceded a burst of sunlight. I stepped into the panoramic atrium offering a birds-eye view of Houston, the Sky Lobby. Despite living in Houston for my entire life, I could never have imagined the city so beautiful. I absorbed the scenes below – the bustling traffic, the diverging currents of the bayou snaking in the distance, and the impersonal skyscrapers dotting the vista, silently taunting our unrestricted zoning laws. I swear I could almost see the curvature of the Earth, two million people all in my field of view.\\n\\nA friendly voice interrupted my gaze. The secretary welcomed me into a grand office that may have passed for a museum. The next moments were a blank. A blurred, neurotic, sweaty blank. Slowly, I walked back to the elevator wide-eyed, almost bewildered. \\n\\nWhile planning my classes at university I never really hoped to attend, I heard a ding signaling the arrival of an email on my phone. “Probably some more spam,” I thought. The title betrayed great news, “Congratulations.”\\n\\nIn his concluding remarks at a Dillard University commencement speech, the great Denzel Washington advised, “Don’t aspire to make a living. Aspire to make a difference.” These words now stick to me like glue. Looking back to when those elevator doors first opened, I believe it was at that moment, with the city at my fingertips, that I aspired to make a difference.\\n\\nBefore, I viewed education as a means to an end, a minor footnote in my transition to the professional world. After that day, I saw the bigger picture. A purposeful education produces change within and bettering the world around me. At Houston Endowment, I learned the ins and outs of the workings of a non-profit foundation. I even had the privilege of personally speaking one-on-one with non-profit executives around Houston. While my internship is generally reserved for students at the end of their college careers, I was able to gain exposure to community and business leaders that have shown me that thoughtful, long-term efforts can make the world a better place. \\n\\nFrom the first moment each Longhorn arrives on the 40 Acres, they receive the message that “What starts here changes the world.” What’s so brilliant about this motto is that it gives the beholder freedom to interpret their place at the university, their communities, and how their education produces ripples of change throughout the world. \\n\\nIt seems to me that to be a Longhorn means to be a leader. To be that which “changes the world.” I don’t feel a similar sense of purpose and community at UH, and feel the path to being leader lies in Austin. With the experiences I gained from my descent into Houston’s philanthropic heart, I intend to hone my dream to be the leader of change that UT trains all its students to be. \\n\\nCommentary\\nI like this essay a lot because it shares a compelling story that frames where they’ve come from academically and professionally, where they currently are, and how UT can help them achieve their goals. They also discussed why they enrolled at the University of Houston, their home city, rather than pursuing UT-Austin’s Coordinated Admissions Program.\\n\\nThey have strong statements throughout that they’re deserving of a space in admissions. They discuss how they will bring a unique perspective to campus and how they seem themselves as a leader on the Forty Acres. They also touch on how their academic goals and beliefs have evolved over time, transitioning from “seeing education as a means to an end” to one where education is a value in itself.\\n\\nIt’s a well-written response that no doubt helped their reviewer form a mental image of the student. It solicits empathy. Everyone can relate to the nervousness of being out of their element and receiving pleasant surprising news when they were otherwise doubtful.\\n\\nDespite their below average GPA, there’s no doubt they gained admission on the strength of this Essay A that helped connect their expanded resume and Essay E about growing up in a mixed-religions household.\\n\\nInterested in building your best transfer application? Complete my questionnaire for a free consultation.\\n\\nMoody College of Communications Admitted Transfer 3.3 GPA \\nI am currently enrolled as a first-year student at Collin College in Frisco, Texas, and I want to finish my studies at the University of Texas in Austin majoring in public relations.\\n\\nMy decision to attend Collin stemmed from my mediocre grades in high school – I wanted a fresh start at a college close to home. Though I was accepted at a few well-ranked Texas public universities, I had higher aspirations. I felt that I could improve my grade point average while completing prerequisite courses transferable anywhere. I lived at home allowing me to save money, help my family, and continue working at my job.\\n\\nDue to my family’s dire financial situation, I initially wanted to pursue a degree in business and finance solely to be more financially secure and allow me the opportunity to raise my own family someday. I took several business-related classes in high school and college. My goal has always been to transfer to UT and earn a degree in finance. \\n\\nIn preparation for transfer, I took Algebra, Pre-calculus, and Calculus 1 and 2. Math is not my strongest subject, and I found Pre-calculus and Calculus to be especially difficult. Despite joining a study group and meeting with the professor but, unfortunately, it wasn’t enough. My low math grades are not for lack of effort. \\n\\nAt the time, I was taking care of my mother, a single parent, and coordinating her transfer to rehab for alcohol addiction. I became the head of household responsible for caring for my three younger sisters. I became a full-time student, employee, and house mom. Instead of getting discouraged by my setback in calculus, I saw it as an opportunity to grow and reconsider my future. I realized that if math isn’t my strong suit, I probably won’t enjoy a career in banking. I feel like many of my friends want to go to business school, but don’t actually enjoy the work or have the skills required to be a successful student. I felt that my decision to pursue finance came not from my own motivations, but pressures from friends, family, and society. \\n\\nI considered my strengths, and now I understand that I love communicating with people and solving problems. I’m the go-to person in my friend group when relationships end or problems happen at school, and I am used to handling family crises at home. I want to help solve problems on behalf of companies, and I feel that public relations is my perfect fit.\\n\\nI learned to communicate effectively at an early age. No matter what situation my family was going through, my sisters and other relatives considered my opinions and often put my suggestions into practice. My survival and quality of life depends on resolving conflicts for work, for my internship, and for relaying messages within a divided family. Recognizing my strength, I feel that public relations would be the perfect major for me. \\n\\nTo gain firsthand experience and test my decision, I took on a Public Relations/Blogger Relations internship for Conscious Couture. Through reaching out to bloggers that have PR firms, I am reassured that I made the right decision and have truly found what I love. Also, I have previous professional experience as an executive assistant for Texas Family Fitness. I was constantly phoning clients, communicating with employees, setting up meetings, proposing new ideas, and managing conflict in the workplace. \\n\\nAfter doing research, I learned that UT has one of the best public relations departments and employs world-renowned faculty. I especially like the internship requirement and career placement resources. My goal is to begin with a major public relations firm and, ultimately, establish my own firm. If I decide to continue my studies after my bachelor’s, the LBJ School of Public Affairs seems like an appealing way to transition into government work. \\n\\nCommentary\\nThis particular student had a 3.0 by the deadline, and since they had less than 24 hours completed, UT waited to make their decision after receiving their spring grades. They made a D in Calculus, so this essay helps put that grade into context.\\n\\nI appreciate that this essay is very straightforward. They get right to the point why they are at their current university, what they hope to study at UT, and how their goals evolved over time.\\n\\nOne pitfall of extenuating circumstances essays is they tend towards hyperbole and overexageration. This applicant provides balance and nuance to their issues at home and concrete ways that they’ve developed and matured over time. They also link their special circumstances into their proposed major, Public Relations.\\n\\nThey also develop well how their professional experiences and internship further influence their decision to transfer. Their Essay A complements and provides context to their expanded resume. They argue convincingly that UT is the best fit for them because of its strong academics while still being close enough to home to visit on the weekends.\\n\\nPutting their poor calculus grade into context, articulating but not going overboard about their special circumstances, and demonstrating their fit for major undoubtedly played a major role in them gaining admission to UT.\\n\\nCheck out my new book Surviving the College Admissions Madness and Youtube Channel\\n\\nOOS Moody College of Communications Admit 3.41 GPA\\nIt was early in 2016 and I needed a job. Seton Hall – my current university – costs about $14,000 per semester just for tuition. Growing up with the potential to be the first in my family to attend college, I never took college enrollment for granted. I saw the financial burden my decision placed on my parents. I came across a job listing for a Human Resources Policy Management Resource for Johnson & Johnson. After a rigorous interview process, they offered me one of three openings among hundreds of college-educated applicants. It was a long shot since I don’t study business and I lack professional experience. My position was no mere internship; I began working in March as a full-time contractor. \\n\\nWith no awareness of the corporate world, I had to learn office politics, bureaucracy, and division of responsibilities on the fly. I updated human resources policies from Johnson & Johnson’s global business holdings and received approval from the policy owner and the legal department. Next, we worked with translators from 30+ languages to convert the documents into their language of origin. Finally, I uploaded the policies onto the HR Portal for the thousands of employees to see. \\n\\nI functioned as the liaison between policy owners and J&J, including those in non-English speaking countries, who were operating in different time zone. Working cross-culturally can be a challenge, but I learned quickly. I stayed organized and met intense deadlines assigned to my team by the Vice President of Global HR Services. I worked thirty to forty hours each week while taking a full course load. \\n\\nBefore my Johnson & Johnson contract expired, the Director of Human Resources, impressed with my work, suggested that I interview for another position. I received a job offer; however, Jeffery Vanderbeek, the former Vice President of the Lehman Brothers and former Chairman and Owner of the New Jersey Devils, called me. Nearing retirement, he recently accepted the football head coach position at Somerville High School near my hometown. Jeff heard about an online radio station I started for my alma matter Immaculata High School. He offered me a job on the spot to run the communications efforts for Somerville Football. I accepted with much excitement so I could continue pursuing my communications passion.\\n\\nI began by building a website and managing their nascent social media channels. I started producing a weekly documentary series following their progress during the season. I hired and managed two media interns. I divided responsibilities and maintained our daily schedule to keep our workflow moving smoothly. Some might write this off as merely doing work for a High School team, but I disagree. \\n\\nI answered every day to a man who occupied corner offices atop Wall Street skyscrapers and oversaw operating budgets in the tens of billions of dollars. He asked same of me as with his Lehman Brothers partners. While that could understandably be stressful, working for Johnson and Johnson prepared me for adapting to pressure and navigating powerful personalities. \\n\\nSomerville and Mr. Vanderbeek helped me become a team player and showcase the best side of their football team. Mr. Vanderbeek served as a mentor to me and everyday pushed me to achieve more. I am eternally grateful for his lessons on leadership and how, with ambition and hard work, I can also rise to the top to my future career, broadcasting.\\n\\nI visited UT in October and immediately felt at home. I sat impressed through a taping for Texas Student Television in the Moody College of Communications. I had been around video production for a number of years, but never had I seen such a group of talented professionals my age working so passionately. It really brought about much excitement within me and reignited the fire I have for the profession. The RTF program at UT is a world-class education with deep industry connections. It is where I need to be.\\n\\nCommentary\\nLike the previous example, this straightforward essay addresses all of the things that UT reviewers are looking for. They discuss the context and buyer’s remorse about attending an expensive private university, but they don’t dwell on it. \\n\\nInstead, they focus on their strengths - pursuing a highly selective and well-paying internship and relevant social media/broadcasting examples. Since they had an influential mentor who also submitted a reference letter, their Essay A develops well their argument that they are prepared to succeed at UT-Austin.\\n\\nThey applied as an out-of-state student from New Jersey, so they also address in their last paragraph how UT can help them achieve their goals. Providing specific observations from their visit let’s the review know that they are making an informed decision to transfer.\\n\\nAlthough they changed their major from RTF to Journalism after arriving on campus, they secured a recent, highly prestigious internship at the CBS Morning Show in Manhattan. They are also involved with Texas Student Television, so there’s no doubt UT extending this student an offer pays dividends for the university. \\n\\nUT-Austin utilizes the transfer process to bring leaders onto campus who can introduce different perspectives to classroom discussions and student organizations.\",\n",

       " {'instruction': 'How do I make a software like Obsidian with Python',\n",
       "  'output': 'To make a software like Obsidian with Python, you will need to have a strong understanding of both Python and software development in general. Obsidian is a powerful tool for creating and managing knowledge, and making a similar software with Python would require a significant amount of work.\\n\\nHere are the basic steps you would need to take to make a software like Obsidian with Python:\\n\\n1. First, you would need to decide on the specific features and functionality that you want your software to have. Obsidian is a very feature-rich tool, so you may want to focus on creating a simpler version of the software that includes only the most essential features.\\n2. Once you have a clear idea of what your software will do, you will need to start designing the user interface. This will involve creating wireframes and mockups of the various screens and features of your software, to help you visualize how it will look and work.\\n3. Next, you will need to start writing the code for your software. This will involve using Python to create the various components of your software, including the user interface, the data storage and management systems, and any other features or functionality that you have planned.\\n4. As you work on the code for your software, you will also need to test it regularly to ensure that it is working as intended. This will involve using various testing tools and techniques to verify that the different components of your software are functioning properly.\\n5. Once your software is complete and has been thoroughly tested, you will need to package it and distribute it to users. This may involve creating an installer program, publishing the software on online platforms, or providing it as a download from your own website.\\n\\nOverall, creating a software like Obsidian with Python will require a significant amount of time, effort, and expertise. It is not a task that can be completed quickly or easily, but with dedication and hard work, it is certainly possible.'},\n",

       "  'output': \"Sure, here's one possible approach to building a two-way sign language translator app:\\n\\n1. Collect sign language data: The first step would be to collect a large dataset of sign language videos or animations for different words, phrases, and sentences. You can either create these videos/animations yourself or use existing ones.\\n2. Train a sign language recognition model: Once you have a dataset, you can train a machine learning model to recognize sign language gestures and translate them into text or speech. There are various approaches to this, such as using computer vision techniques to analyze hand movements or using sensors to capture data from gloves worn by sign language users.\\n3. Train a speech recognition model: Similarly, you can train a machine learning model to recognize speech and convert it into text. There are many existing speech recognition APIs and libraries you can use for this step.\\n4. Integrate the two models: Once you have trained both models, you can integrate them into a single app that can recognize both sign language and speech inputs and translate them accordingly. You'll need to design an intuitive user interface that allows users to switch between the two modes easily.\\n5. Test and refine: Finally, you'll need to test the app with actual sign language users and speech users to see how well it performs and make adjustments as needed. You may also want to consider adding additional features, such as a dictionary of common sign language phrases or the ability to save frequently used phrases for easier access.\\n\\nOverall, building a two-way sign language translator app is a complex task that requires expertise in machine learning, computer vision, and app development. However, with the right approach and resources, it is definitely possible to create an effective and useful tool for sign language communication.\"},\n",

You can calculate the percent error as follows:\\n\\npercent error = (|9.5 - 10| / 10) x 100%\\npercent error = (0.5 / 10) x 100%\\npercent error = 5%\\n\\nThis means that the experimental value has an error of 5% compared to the theoretical value.\"},\n",

Always speak as \"I\" and never as \"we\".\\nMy first real teamwork experience was during my first year of engineering school, where I lead as a project leader an open project, aiming to sensibilize people to food\\'s waste. I was managing a group of 7 people, and doing plannification. I was confronted to the difficulties of the management and ressource allowance, and this really gave me the desire to lead teams later on. The project was a real success as I managed to adapt threw the covid crises and meet my objectives.\\nMy second real experience was during my first internship, at the year of my first year of engineering school. I worked at Nyrstar, and i was in charge of analyzing the processes and data, make dashboards, in order to optimize the process. The final goal of this internship was to be able to monitor, understand and control the temperatures of the process. It was a factory producing huge quantities of zinc, and I took my time to analyze the environnement and the available data. I succed at my mission as we were able to reduce the average temperature by 1° thanks to my actions. Reducing the temperature permit to produce more and therefore to make more money. I made my own routine collecting data as nothing was in place, and after some time making sense with my environnement I was able to make a complete system collecting, extracting and treating data. Dashboards were only made with Excel and Uniformance. I think my main achievement during this internship was to make more with less as I didnt have ressources available. i always found ways to do better with what I had, and i was able to provide meaningful recommendations to keep the temperature low. Many of the reporting tools I\\'ve deployed are still used nowadays and helped them surviving the energy crisis as temperature management became even more an issue for them. This internship lasted 3 months.\\nMy next serious work experience was at Enedis, during my second year of engineering school. I was in charge of completely redesigning the reporting system and make a visual management system for the support service of Enedis. It was an highly eniriching experience for me, as I was in complete autonomy and no one had technical skills in my filed in the service. I had actually to make everything from scratch as they only had excel directly copied from exports. My first mission was to make the dashboard for the intern client, on half of the activity. It was actually my inital mission, but I achieved after spending 4 full days meeting and understanding the need of the customers, I was able to come up with a solutions that suits every stakeholders by providing optimized VBA dashboards with visual management in a week only. It took then several week to implement additionnal features and ajust the dashboard so it was ready to be used. I had no skills in VBA and I quickly learnt thanks to my proficiency in SQL, ETL and python. i was able in a month to basically do what I wanted in VBA, and deliver results quick. I really cared about the customer experience during my whole internship and i\\'ve been sending surveys to know theirs thought about the tools I was delivering them. i went from 56% satisfaction at the beginning of my internship to 78% at the end (on 99 regional managers). I was able to complete my mission way ahead of my time, and I was in charge to generalize the reporting tools and automated tools to the whole country, including the other activity, and the service that was in south of france (the division where I was working in was split in half). The responsibilities of the project totaly overcame what was defined but that was completely fine as I had the opportunity to do weekly meeting with the TOP 3 of Enedis so we could discuss changes and new way to do things. I even automated certains tools, including one that lead to save more than $50k per year in manpower. I started projects on my own too, such as a simple VBA excel file that was allowing my coworkers to calculated theirs CO2 consumption depending on their mode of transport and the distance.\\nI was in charge of making the dashboards for the intern performances of my coworker too, and I automated the file that was used to affect the work load. I hugely contributed to improve process and reduce wastes, and I really loved the direct impact that I had threw my data analysis, my business recommendations and that i had to adapt to a complex environnement. My responsibilites grew really fast as I was able to deliver in time, and I managed the workload during my whole internship even if deadlines were shorts. i achieved a lot of project on my own thanks to the autonomy granted and the trust given. i learnt a lot from my mistakes during this internship, both technically and humanely. Dealing with a lot of different stakeholders was a very intersting experience as I realized it would become one of the most important aspect of my work. I really felt that I could make a big impact threw my professional life during this internship by combining my technical and analytical skills to my soft skills.

       " {'instruction': 'This an article by Michael Mankins and Mark Gottfredson\\nIn crafting strategy, companies often struggle to cope with volatility. Using the traditional strategic-planning model, managers attempt to forecast how markets will evolve and competitors will respond, and then define a multiyear plan for winning in that future state. The organization is then called upon to execute that plan. Performance is routinely monitored, ostensibly to keep everyone on track.\\n\\nThat approach worked well when markets were more stable and the primary factors influencing future growth and profitability were easier to forecast. Consider commercial aviation. From 1980 to 2000 growth in that sector was relatively constant, with air traffic miles growing at just under 5% a year. Manufacturers and airlines employed discrete models to assess investments in new commercial-airplane programs and to plan fleets. Airbus and Boeing expanded aggressively over those two decades: The global fleet tripled from 5,000 to nearly 15,000 aircraft.\\n\\nBut then came the 9/11 terrorist attacks, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, oil price spikes, the global financial crisis, environmental concerns, SARS, and Covid-19. Forecasting commercial air travel became arduous and complex and was frequently wrong. And that’s just one industry.\\n\\nMost companies have stuck with conventional techniques for strategy-making, to the detriment of customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\\n\\nThe world is now changing so quickly that no business can plan for every eventuality. Scholars and practitioners have spent years crafting tools and frameworks for strategy development under uncertainty—including, most notably, scenario planning, Monte Carlo simulation, and real options analysis. Each of those represented a significant advance. Scenario planning, which became popular in the 1970s, encouraged executives to consider multiple future states in assessing strategic investments, rather than rely on a single, deterministic forecast. Monte Carlo simulation went even further, specifying a probability distribution for each critical variable and then running thousands of simulations so that executives would focus on the distribution of potential outcomes as much as on any prediction of the most likely one. Real options analysis emerged as a further refinement in the 1980s, explicitly incorporating flexibility in the consideration of strategic investments.\\n\\nBut none of those techniques has caught on widely. Fewer than a quarter of large organizations regularly apply them in capital budgeting, fewer still in strategic planning. Executives tell us that the tools require data that is impractical to gather and analysis that is too expensive to perform routinely. Moreover, the output can be counterintuitive and complicated to explain to senior leaders and a company’s board. The upshot: Most companies have stuck with conventional techniques for strategy-making—even in the face of extreme volatility—to the detriment of customers, shareholders, and other stakeholders.\\n\\nWe believe that business leaders need to reconsider what good strategy looks like in turbulent times—and to think of strategy-making as a continuous process that generates a living, dynamic plan. In this article we describe what it takes to produce great results during uncertainty and propose a practical model for strategy development that we have seen work at several leading companies.\\n\\nA Continuous Process\\nDell Technologies is one company that has made the shift. In 2014, shortly after Michael Dell took his company private, its leaders put in place a new, continuous approach to strategy development and resource allocation. At its core is the “Dell agenda,” a backlog of strategic issues and opportunities that must be addressed to improve the long-term performance and intrinsic value of the company. Rather than devise a “strategic plan” to address the agenda, Dell’s executive leadership team defines a multiyear outlook (MYO) for each of the company’s businesses. The MYO establishes a forecast for the performance trajectory of each business on the basis of decisions leadership has already made; it does not incorporate decisions that leaders might make in the future.\\nJamie Chung/Trunk Archive\\nThe MYO is compared with a multiyear performance goal that is defined separately and tied to leadership’s strategic and financial aspirations for the company. Invariably a gap exists between the MYO and those aspirations. This is helpful and a cornerstone of the approach: The Dell agenda focuses the company’s executives on making the decisions necessary to close that gap. Moreover, the Dell agenda is evergreen: As soon as one issue has effectively been addressed (and the MYO updated to reflect the resulting performance commitments), a new issue is added to the agenda from the backlog. As a result, Dell has a “living plan”—which captures all decisions that have been made—and a process focused on making decisions to drive better performance.\\n\\nThinking of strategy-making as continuous and generating a living plan enables executives to build on what’s best about existing tools for coping with uncertainty—leading to more-flexible strategies and more-agile strategy-making.',\n",
       "  'output': \"In this article, the authors argue that traditional strategic planning is no longer effective in today's fast-changing world. They claim that instead of trying to forecast the future and devise a multiyear plan, companies should adopt a continuous approach to strategy development. This approach involves regularly updating a backlog of strategic issues and opportunities, defining a multiyear outlook for each business, and allocating resources accordingly. The authors suggest that this approach has been effective for companies such as Dell Technologies and Medtronic.\"},\n",
       " {'instruction': 'The second step is\\n2. Identify Strategic Hedges and Options\\nIn an uncertain world, flexibility has tremendous value. If at the start of your commute you foresee the potential for traffic congestion, for instance, you might choose to avoid an elevated highway (with few off-ramps or on-ramps) and take a more flexible if longer route to save time. Likewise, leaders can incorporate the value of flexibility—in the form of hedges and options—into their strategic decision-making.\\n\\nReal options analysis emerged as a methodology to help companies better account for this value. A real option represents a right but not an obligation to undertake some business decision, which means that the option holder can delay further investment until additional information has been analyzed. Techniques based on financial option pricing allow analysts—given the right data—to quantify the value of being able to delay or walk away from an investment. In the early 2000s real options analysis was widely seen as a cutting-edge tool for valuing natural resource investments, formulating new product-development plans, analyzing R&D spending, making acquisitions, and evaluating technology investments. Sadly, it has never really taken hold in strategic planning. Strategists have struggled to specify the model’s parameters sufficiently to render its output useful to them.\\n\\nIn our view, companies have sidelined real options analysis prematurely, paying far too much attention to the mechanics of determining the absolute value of a specific real option rather than relying on the tool’s basic principles to understand the relative value of competing strategy alternatives. For example, if two alternatives are equally capable of addressing a company’s competitive issues, but one provides greater flexibility to alter course, defer investment, or redeploy resources on the basis of better information, that one has a higher relative value in most instances and should be selected. We encourage leaders to account for the value of flexibility in evaluating strategy alternatives, even when it is challenging (or maybe impossible) to quantify it absolutely.\\n\\nStrategic flexibility has a variety of sources. In some instances new technology can create it. For instance, many railroads are replacing their aging locomotives with new engines. As the volatility of fuel prices has increased, deciding which fuel to choose for future locomotives has become critical. Starting in 2016 the spread between oil and natural gas prices increased significantly, creating an opportunity to shift to natural gas to fuel future locomotives. But no one could be sure whether the spread would persist or whether it would widen or narrow. At the same time, locomotive technology was changing, with flexible-fuel locomotives emerging as a viable alternative to single-fuel engines. The latter are less expensive but, obviously, far less flexible. Depending on a railroad’s route structure, customer base, and strategy, the flexibility offered by the new engines can offset the additional up-front cost of purchasing them.\\n\\nOften, though, the situation is less clear-cut, and leadership teams must choose between options with wildly differing payoffs, depending on how the future unfolds. By accounting for the value of flexibility, executives can often uncover strategies that allow them to hedge their bets while preserving valuable options for the future.\\n\\nWalt Disney is a case in point. Several years ago Disney’s leaders realized that streaming was threatening the viability of traditional cable and satellite services. In August 2017 Disney announced that it would acquire majority ownership of BAMTech, a global leader in direct-to-consumer streaming technology and marketing services. Disney’s $1.58 billion investment caused a stir at the time, leaving investors wondering why the company would put so much into a relatively small platform (an offshoot of Major League Baseball). But that acquisition put the company in a position to launch Disney+ just over two years later. Four months after its investment in BAMTech, Disney initiated an acquisition of 21st Century Fox. At first that $71.3 billion investment looked like an attempt to double down on traditional broadcast media. But the acquisition was in fact a hedge, providing Disney with access to Fox’s extensive film library—a collection that would be valuable no matter which distribution model persevered over the long term.\\n\\nDisney’s investments in strategic hedges and options enabled the company to pull far ahead of less-prescient rivals and led to a doubling of its market value between 2017 and 2020. Other organizations are following Disney’s example as part of their long-term strategy.\\n\\nIt’s important to note that investing in strategic hedges and options is not the same as placing a bet on every square. Trying to reduce risk in that way makes it nearly impossible for a company to score a big win (after all, we’ve seen few examples of relatively small positions being parlayed into market leadership) and locks in the certainty of many small losses that add up to real money. Worse yet, juggling a list of competing bets dilutes leadership focus, wastes precious time, and squanders scarce talent, further compounding the damage.\\n\\nConsider Dell once again. In the years before 2013, not knowing how technologies would play out, Dell invested across the board in smartphones, tablets, Chromebooks, printers, consumer PCs, commercial laptops and desktops, workstations, servers, storage, IT services, and software. Beyond PCs, workstations, and servers, Dell was a distant follower in most of the markets in which it had paid handsomely to play.\\nJamie Chung/Trunk Archive\\nOnly after Dell anchored its decision-making in extreme but plausible scenarios—ranging from the death of the PC to mobility everywhere—did the leadership team realize how many of its small bets were unlikely to pay off. Smartphones, tablets, and printers were among the first to be cut. Later the company jettisoned IT services and software. But the analysis also highlighted areas where it could double down on its investments and potentially win in the long term. Accordingly, Dell simplified its PC and server portfolios and reinvested a portion of the resulting savings to improve product design.\\n\\nThose moves (and others) helped Dell win as the personal computer and server markets commoditized and consolidated. By exiting multiple markets to focus its bets in a strategic way, Dell drove up its operating income more than threefold from 2013 to 2020, and the company’s market value increased by 420%.',\n",
       "  'output': 'The authors of this article argue that traditional strategic planning is no longer effective in today\\'s fast-changing world. Instead of trying to forecast the future and create a multiyear plan, they recommend a continuous approach to strategy development that involves regularly updating a backlog of strategic issues and opportunities, defining a multiyear outlook for each business, and allocating resources accordingly. This approach has been effective for companies such as Dell Technologies and Medtronic. The authors suggest that the first step in this approach is to define extreme but plausible scenarios, rather than best-case, worst-case, and base-case scenarios. This allows companies to identify \"no regret\" moves that will be valuable under most scenarios and to avoid making risky investments. The second step is to identify strategic hedges and options that can be used to address the uncertainty generated by these scenarios. The third step is to continuously allocate resources in response to changing conditions. The fourth step is to monitor performance and adjust the plan as needed. The final step is to embed this approach into the organization\\'s culture.'},\n",

Many of the company’s experiments have spawned profitable new businesses—think Marketplace, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Prime. Others, however, fared less well and were shut down quickly: Crucible, the company’s foray into multiplayer gaming; Haven, its health care joint venture with JPMorgan and Berkshire Hathaway; and Spark, Amazon’s attempt to build an Instagram-like shopping platform. But even the failures provided important lessons that helped Bezos and his team make future investments more successful. Its test-and-learn culture has made Amazon one of the most innovative and valuable companies in the world.\\n\\nLeaders should set concrete guidelines for where they choose to experiment, because running many small experiments can quickly degenerate into placing many small bets—a losing strategy, as we’ve noted. At Amazon, for example, experimentation is confined to testing “dreamy” ideas—ideas that customers love, that could become very large businesses, that could generate very strong returns, and that have a decent chance of enduring.\\n\\nMarketplace, AWS, and Prime all met those guidelines. Take Prime: No one on the Amazon team could point to data showing that giving customers free shipping for a yearly subscription fee would ever pay for itself. Through experimentation, first in select local markets and then globally, Amazon was able to validate the idea and build Prime into a $25 billion business by 2020, 15 years after it launched. In summary, small experiments are perfectly fine (in fact, encouraged), but each experiment should be tied to something very big to ensure that the test is worth running. Correctly applied, experiments prove the viability of big bets.',\n",

The leadership team meets, typically quarterly, to review each unit’s performance against plan and identify variances. In some cases leaders push for better performance; in others they simply revise the plan to accommodate the variances. In such situations performance reviews provide little if any useful surveillance regarding likely future conditions or helpful guidance as to whether the company should consider changing direction.\\n\\nTo become more adaptable to changing conditions, leaders must approach performance monitoring with a new mindset. The central question cannot be “How did we perform?” Instead it must be “Should we alter course?”\\n\\nAnswering that question requires more and different information than does the standard weather report. Leaders must understand the root causes of any performance shortfall. And they must have prepared contingency plans that can be put into motion speedily to address any significant changes in market or competitive conditions. A few leading companies have created thresholds for grading signposts green, yellow, or red. When a signpost crosses a critical threshold, it signals a change in direction (red) or a need for deeper investigation (yellow).\\n\\nTetra Pak, an €11 billion food-packaging and -processing company headquartered in Switzerland and Sweden, has this type of performance monitoring in place. In devising the company’s strategy, its leaders considered four scenarios, ranging from go green faster to strong push toward commoditization. The company tracks 42 signposts each quarter, including leading indicators such as the percentage of packaging required by law to be recycled in key geographies, the percentage price increase realized on packs with sustainability features, the percentage share of e-commerce players in the food and beverage segment, and average operating margins of food and beverage retailers.\\n\\nCEO Adolfo Orive and his team keep quarterly business reviews focused on the future (“What do we need to do?”), not the past (“What were our sales in India last quarter?”). When signposts suggest a move toward one scenario over the others, management takes steps to accelerate its existing programs or launch new ones. That has enabled Tetra Pak to adapt its strategy quickly to fundamental shifts in environmental policy and customer preferences. To take just one of many examples at the company, as price elasticity in its largest markets increased far faster than its base forecast—a flashing-red indicator of commoditization—Tetra Pak accelerated its push toward lower-cost packaging. The new model has also made performance monitoring at the company far more action oriented and consequential, resulting in much higher levels of growth and profitability.\\n\\nAlthough many promising tools have been developed to help cope with uncertainty, most executives struggle in consistently applying them to make better decisions. Winning in uncertain times requires a new model for strategy development. Companies that move quickly to adopt the more dynamic approach we’ve set out will pull ahead—and stay ahead—in the coming decades. Those that stick with their “plan then do” ways risk falling irreparably behind.',\n",

       " {'instruction': 'David J. Collis goes on to say\\nThe Incumbent’s Mistake\\nCEOs of established companies often pay too much attention to defining how their firms will capture value and too little to new ways to create value and how firms’ activities and capabilities need to evolve over time. One reason is that approaches focusing on capture (like the five forces) have been very successful in long-established and stable industries and as a result have become ingrained in the strategy process. But CEOs of mature companies should ask themselves, When did our annual strategy process last generate a truly breakthrough idea, like ride-sharing or mobile banking? When did it allow us to become the “disruptive” innovator?\\n\\nLook at the list of the most valuable companies in the United States, and you’ll see that discovering and exploiting new business models to satisfy previously unmet, unexpressed, or even unknown customer needs is where the action has been in recent years. Those companies didn’t collectively create trillions of dollars in value by outpositioning their rivals. When they were founded, they didn’t have rivals. Indeed, the kind of businesses they started didn’t exist previously.\\n\\nWinning with a New Business Model. The most valuable companies in America all launched brand new business models that met previously unfulfilled or unidentified needs. Here are the five largest U.S companies by market cap, as of April 12, 20 21: One: Apple, founded in 1976, now worth 2 point 2 trillion dollars. Two: Microsoft, founded in 1975, now worth 1 point 9 trillion dollars. Three: Amazon, founded in 1994, now worth 1 point 7 trillion dollars. Four: Alphabet, founded in 1998, now worth 1 point 5 trillion dollars. Five: Facebook, founded in 2004, now worth 880 billion dollars. Source: Yahoo Finance\\nThe good news for leaders of incumbent companies is that the emergence of new approaches doesn’t have to doom their enterprises. Indeed, if they take a holistic perspective on strategy, they may discover that those business models present attractive opportunities because they create more value.\\n\\nFor example, would you rather make a onetime sale of a physical product or build a long-term client relationship and deliver tailored solutions that generate more value for the customer and potentially much more profit for you? As some old-line companies have discovered, the latter is the opportunity that new digital business models offer firms that can effectively leverage data and analytics. Komatsu now offers subscriptions to its Smart Construction platform, which coordinates all the activities of a construction site, including drone surveys, dumptruck scheduling, and the operation of autonomous earthmoving equipment. The platform cuts construction projects’ entire costs by well over 15%—creating far more value than the revenue from the sale of bulldozers, which was all that was available in Komatsu’s previous model. In a somewhat similar fashion, Siemens uses artificial intelligence to predict, and so prevent, maintenance issues on its trains. The improvement in uptime performance allows it to switch to performance-based contracts for rail service that bring in thousands of dollars a day, rather than just the initial price of a train.\\n\\nNo incumbent should respond to every new business model—that would simply be playing whack-a-mole. Instead, a firm must develop a strategic approach to identifying the value-creation potential of models and then determine whether to pursue any new ones by predicting the outcome of competition among alternative models.\\n\\nBy using available tools, strategists could have foreseen, for example, that video on demand (streaming) would replace Netflix’s original mail-order delivery of DVDs and Blockbuster’s old-fashioned video stores. The superiority of the value proposition for the job to be done for the customer, which was “delivering personal video entertainment,” suggests the absolute dominance of streaming. An examination of the purchase criteria you might consider—convenience, the ability to make an impulse purchase, access to recent best sellers, a large back catalog—reveals that video on demand serves customers better than either of the earlier business models. If that weren’t enough, the cost of delivering movies and TV shows over the internet is vastly lower than doing so via physical stores or the mail. Considering those advantages, it’s no wonder that almost everyone is now paying monthly subscription fees to streaming services.\\n\\nWhy Streaming Video Beat Rival Models. Its value proposition was much stronger than the propositions of video stores and DVD-by-mail on almost every dimension, and its costs were far lower. Streaming video excelled on price, convenience, variety of titles, immediate access, availability of best sellers, functionality on multiple devices, variety of media delivered, and ability to connect to other applications and platforms. DVD-by-mail excelled only on variety of titles. Video stores did not excel on any dimension. The cost of delivering a video to a customer was only 25 cents for streaming in 2007, but 1 dollar and 25 cents for DVD-by-mail and 2 dollars and 24 cents for video stores. Source: Author analysis, “Netflix in 20 11,” an HBS case study by Willy Shih and Stephen P. Kaufman\\nIn contrast, a similar analysis suggests that Amazon’s online business model, which consists of a retail website, a limited number of fulfillment centers, and fleets of delivery trucks, will never fully displace Walmart’s longtime business model, which features traditional brick-and-mortar stores supplied by a national network of distribution centers. When you compare how well each does the job to be done, you see that Amazon’s model is good at providing home delivery for a very broad range (hundreds of millions) of items, while Walmart’s is better for immediate availability at low cost of a more limited number (a few hundred thousand). Each business model has a distinctive proposition that appeals to different customers on different occasions for different products. And a comparison of the cost positions of their asset bases shows that Walmart’s logistics system is low cost for everyday items that consumers pick up in stores in rural or suburban locations, while Amazon’s is more efficient for long-tail items and home delivery in densely populated geographies. Neither business model universally dominates the other. Both will survive, which is why each company is rushing to replicate the other’s asset base, with Amazon buying Whole Foods, and Walmart spending billions of dollars to expand online and add fulfillment centers.',\n",

       " {'instruction': 'David J. Collis adds\\nThe Entrepreneur’s Mistake\\nIn their excitement to exploit new opportunities they spotted before anyone else, many entrepreneurs fail to see that the more value their business model creates, the more competition they’re likely to face. Netflix has been copied by dozens of credible companies, including Disney, and Casper—the innovator of the bed-in-a-box business model—has 175 competitors. Seduced by their immediate success, entrepreneurs often commit to an investment that never pays a worthwhile return. WhatsApp, for example, now faces numerous free-messaging rivals, but its owner, Facebook, has yet to monetize any of its 2 billion users.\\n\\nWhen a firm is pursuing a successful new business model against intense competition, it’s vital to apply the three value-capture frameworks in the middle of the landscape—industry attractiveness, competitive positioning, and competitive interaction. Consider a business model that investors are now enamored with: electric vehicles. In early April, Tesla had the highest market capitalization of any car company ever and the sixth-highest market cap in the United States (hitting $672 billion on April 12)—more than the combined market caps of Ford, GM, Toyota, Daimler, and Volkswagen. Tesla has certainly identified and exploited an appealing business model, but it’s unclear whether it will ever make a decent return on its investment. Why, if the business model creates so much value for customers? The answer lies in the effect that a promising new business model has on other parts of the strategy landscape.\\nTo capture sufficient value, a firm has to be in an industry with an attractive structure and possess a sustainable competitive advantage. Unfortunately, the electric vehicle industry of the future will look remarkably similar to the auto industry of the present. Every carmaker in the world and every company with an interest in electric motors is entering the business. (Even the vacuum cleaner company Dyson invested half a billion dollars in a car design and a plant before realizing the error of its ways.) Given that barriers to entry are low with electric vehicles because of the simplicity of their design and their few (relative to an internal combustion engine) parts, even more companies are likely to jump in. In fact, the quicker the adoption of electric vehicles around the world is, the faster competitors will enter the race and the more rapidly the attractiveness of the industry will deteriorate.\\n\\nNor is it clear that Tesla has a sustainable competitive advantage. It might have a brand aura and a performance edge today, but its design and engineering expertise will soon be challenged by Porsche and other performance manufacturers, like BMW and Mercedes. Moreover, it’s well behind other auto companies in cumulative production experience and overall scale, so its manufacturing cost position is unenviable. Indeed, the need for scale has led Tesla to add more models—it’s now producing seven—which increases its total output to about 500,000 a year but creates inefficiencies.\\n\\nTesla also appears to be finding it challenging to realize value through the effective execution of its strategy. The automaker has had enormous quality problems in the United States. (Consumer Reports no longer recommends the Models S and Y.) If you simply cannot achieve operational efficiencies, you are condemned to fail, regardless of how exciting your business model is.',\n",

It requires an aligned set of choices about which opportunities to pursue, how much value the firm can create and capture, and how to keep realizing value and build a foundation for long-term success. The entire set of strategic decisions comprises these questions: One: What is our opportunity set? What demographic, political, technological, regulatory, and other environmental changes can we exploit? Two: How can we create the most value? What is our business model? What’s the “job to be done” for customers? How will we charge for our product or service? What assets do we need to produce and deliver it? Three: How can we capture value? Does the industry structure allow a decent return? What is our positioning? What is the scope of our business? What is its competitive advantage—its unique value proposition and distinctive configuration of activities? How will our rivals react? Four: How do we keep realizing value over the long term? Will our initiatives build the capabilities we need in the long term? Are we organized to adapt to change? Five: How strong is the outcome? Does our performance provide us enough resources to support desirable future moves?\\nThe second control mechanism lies in selection of the tactical projects pursued. Here, the CEO must be able to see through the fog of immediate pressures and identify and support a limited number of long-term initiatives that will guide the individual experiments. Typically, these become “corporate” initiatives, even if in smaller firms nothing that fancy is ever announced. They’re not objectives, since they lack a time frame and specific metrics, but broad themes that govern the sequence, selection, and design of multiple projects. They must be injected into every ongoing change program in the firm that cuts across silos and boundaries.\\n\\nThese broad initiatives should be manageable in number—probably seven or fewer—so that each can be adequately funded, monitored, and continually promoted. They cannot change regularly; if that happens, they’ll be viewed as “flavors of the month” that can be ignored or met with lip service.\\n\\nCEOs of mature companies should ask themselves, When did our annual strategy process last generate a truly breakthrough idea, like ride-sharing or mobile banking?\\n\\nThese higher-level strategic programs must be owned and championed by the CEO. Only the firm’s top leader has the perspective and authority to ensure there’s enough investment in building the capabilities they’ll require. One example is the “digitalization” initiative at Siemens that Joe Kaeser spearheaded. Another is the Creating the New initiative at Adidas, which Herbert Hainer started and his successor, Kasper Rørsted, is continuing; it focuses on speed (in order to offer consumers “exactly the products they want to buy whenever, wherever, and however they want to buy”), key strategic cities (to spot emerging trends), and open-source innovation (collaborating with third parties in industry, sports, and entertainment). A third example is Bob Iger’s commitment to invest in quality branded franchises, technology, and globalization during his 14 years at the helm of Walt Disney. Each CEO took personal responsibility for shepherding progress in the chosen areas.\\n\\nIt is the outcome of these “must-win” battles that determines long-run success. Though these broad themes or initiatives are not corporate strategies—as they are often mistakenly called—their pursuit is an essential part of a complete strategy.',\n",
       "  'output': 'David J. Collis is a professor emeritus of business administration at Harvard Business School, where he taught courses on corporate strategy. In his article, Collis discusses the importance of a holistic approach to strategy and the need for companies to focus on creating value, rather than simply trying to capture it. He argues that the most successful companies are those that discover and exploit new business models that meet previously unfulfilled or unidentified needs. To capture value, a firm must be in an attractive industry and possess a sustainable competitive advantage, and it must be able to adapt to change and build the capabilities needed for long-term success.'},\n",
       " {'instruction': 'David J. Collis concludes:\\nThe solution is not to alter the company’s competitive position. If Edward Jones changed its customer scope by serving day traders, it would be positioned in the most price-competitive part of the market. If it altered its model of entrepreneurial advisers who are embedded in communities, it would lose its cooperative, client-interests-first culture. The best hope for escaping commoditization is to pursue business model innovation that creates more value and potentially monetizes it in ways other than just a commission on each transaction.\\n\\nEdward Jones is therefore following the path that other professional services firms have taken and is shifting from a product, or “transactional,” business model to a financial life “solutions” business model. Through a five-step process that begins with documenting individual goals, the firm now offers customized advice and solutions for lifelong needs, not just purchases of mutual funds or blue-chip stocks. Though this approach requires more-intense engagement with customers, it creates substantially more value for them.\\n\\nMany entrepreneurs fail to see that the more value their business model creates, the more competition they’re likely to face.\\n\\nIn its efforts to successfully shift to the financial life solutions model, Edward Jones has identified must-win battles in several areas, including diversity (while about half of Generation Z is nonwhite, fewer than 15% of the firm’s advisers belong to minority groups); intergenerational wealth transfer (an estimated $40 trillion in assets will be inherited by Millennials); and multichannel distribution (to effectively serve a full range of clients regardless of net worth and to complement in-person services with digital interactions). The firm has created teams, each of which works on part of a broader initiative—for instance, how to enter urban markets with a large minority population—to develop and test approaches addressing those challenges. Specific projects will come and go over time, but the focus on building capabilities required for long-term success will remain.\\n\\nNotice that we need to look at the whole strategy landscape to understand the change under way at Edward Jones. First, new developments (in demographics, regulation, capital markets’ performance, and so on) are throwing up novel threats and opportunities. Second, the reduction in value capture for the industry is undermining the old business model. Third, the business model itself now needs to be retooled to create more value even if the competitive positioning is unchanged. And fourth, the revisions will take place through projects that support broader strategic initiatives.\\n\\nThe most important lesson is that to craft a resilient strategy, companies of all sizes must integrate all the elements of the complete strategy landscape. While not disregarding how critical competitive positioning is to value capture, an effective strategy process must begin with a creative and open-ended discussion of the value potential of alternative business models and finish with an approach to execution that guides ongoing experimentation and operational adaptation while investing in underlying capabilities.\\n\\nStrategy has always been about aligning the organization behind a clear direction. Today it must be broadened to become an integrated set of choices about the business model, competitive positioning, and capabilities required for long-term success. By managing the complete strategy landscape, CEOs of young ventures will greatly increase the odds that their firms won’t crash and burn, and leaders of established companies will ensure that they continually renew themselves.',\n",
       "  'output': 'David J. Collis is a professor emeritus at the Harvard Business School and a senior adviser at Bain & Company. In this article, he discusses the importance of a comprehensive approach to strategy, which he refers to as the \"complete strategy landscape\". According to Collis, this landscape is made up of four key elements: opportunity set, business model, competitive positioning, and realization of value over time. By considering all of these elements together, companies can better align their activities and make better strategic decisions. Collis uses the example of Edward Jones, a brokerage firm that is shifting its business model to a \"financial life solutions\" model in response to changes in the industry. By considering how this change will impact all aspects of its strategy, Edward Jones is able to make the shift more successfully.'},\n",

Collis article it is claimed that managers tend to make mistakes regarding strategy and its implementation. \\u200b\\u200bChoose one of the mistakes mentioned in their articles and explain briefly why you think this is a strategic mistake and not a tactical mistake.',\n",
       "  'output': \"One mistake mentioned in the articles is when managers underestimate the impact of new technologies and business models on the value provided to customers. This is a strategic mistake because it shows a lack of understanding of the potential opportunities and threats presented by these changes, and how they can affect the firm's competitive positioning and business model. By failing to anticipate and adapt to these changes, the firm may lose its competitive advantage and miss out on potential growth opportunities. In a VUCA (Volatility, uncertainty, complexity and ambiguity) environment, where change is constant and unpredictable, this mistake can be particularly damaging, as it can leave the firm vulnerable to disruption and competitive pressures. Therefore, it is important for managers to continuously monitor and assess the impact of new technologies and business models on their industry, and to develop a strategic plan to adapt and capitalize on these changes.\"},\n",

We started having hares in the park, beautiful butterflies flying everywhere. It was a time of lots of blossoming, and also a moment when I blossomed from being a pianist into a composer.” Musical ideas captured in over 500 recorded piano improvisations were transformed by Blais into 11 compositions performed by a 12-person ensemble. During the composition process, Blais collaborated with Alex Weston, former music assistant to Philip Glass. The musicians were recorded with close-up microphones, creating a richly intimate atmosphere that captures the human behind each instrument, from the mechanics of the woodwind keys to the snap of a double bass... more\\ncredits\\nreleased February 4, 2022\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nMKX\\\\_300dpi\\n\\n \\n\\nCerys Weetch\\n\\nLabel / A&R Manager\\n\\nMercury KX, 4 Pancras Square, London, N1C 4AG\\n\\nM: +44 (0)7792959309\\n\\nwww.mercurykx.com\\n\\n---',\n",

       " {'instruction': \"Please also read this CLASSIC FM ARTICLE ON PIECES WRITTEN FOR LEFT HAND:\\n\\nThe best classical music for piano left hand\\n12 August 2014, 12:56 | Updated: 6 January 2017, 14:45\\n\\nFacebook share Twitter share\\nIn celebration of International Left Handers Day, we're investigating the top ten pieces of piano music composed specifically for the left hand, as chosen by one-handed piano virtuoso, Nicholas McCarthy.\\n\\n1. Prelude and Nocturne Op. 9 - Scriabin\\n\\nAfter injuring his right hand learning some of Liszt's more challenging music, Scriabin was forced to re-evaluate his priorities and change the way he composed, shifting the emphasis onto his uninjured left hand. Much of the music he went on to write sounds fiendishly difficult, making the most of the capabilities of his only working hand - but he also composed two pieces for left hand only. After much soul-searching, the result is this, one of Scriabin's most beautiful and introspective pieces.\\n\\n2. Piano Concerto for the Left Hand - Ravel\\n\\nEven before this piece was premiered in 1932, pianist Alfred Cortot had made an arrangement for piano two-hands and orchestra. But Ravel, who wrote the music especially for Austrian pianist Paul Wittgenstein after he lost his arm in the war, forbade the performance of the new arrangement. It's not a wonder he was frustrated: before writing the work, he studied Saint-Saëns' left hand études religiously, absorbing as many of his techniques as possible.\\n\\n\\n3. Chaconne in D minor - Bach/Brahms\\n\\nThere's nothing like getting stuck in to some truly meaty Bach keyboard music. So, imagine Clara Schumann's frustration when she injured her right hand and could no longer play the music she knew and loved. Luckily, Brahms came to the rescue with this ingenious arrangement of his hypnotic Chaconne in D minor. It may only be played with one hand, but Brahms manages to bring out every one of Bach's original voices. Genius.\\n\\n\\n4. Etude Op. 25 No. 12 'Ocean' - Chopin arr. Godowsky\\n\\nThey're known as the most difficult piano pieces in the left-hand repertoire, and after listening to these waves upon waves of notes, it's easy to see why. Chopin's études - challenging enough at the best of times - have been transformed by Polish composer Godowsky into a series of incredible studies and mind-bending technical exercises, including transferring the technically difficult passages between hands, interweaving separate études to form one individual piece, and transcribing this entire étude for left hand solo.\\n\\n5. Three Improvisations - Bridge\\n\\nEerie and beautiful, these 'improvisations' by English composer Frank Bridge were written for his friend Douglas Fox, who lost his arm during the First World War. With sparing use of the piano pedals, the heavy bass chords ring out as the left hand glides over the piano's upper register.\\n\\n\\n6. Piano Concerto for Left Hand - Korngold\\n\\nThe man behind Ravel's piano concerto for left hand, Paul Wittgenstein, is really the man to thank when it comes to commissioning music for the left hand. He approached Richard Strauss, Prokofiev, and Hindemith - but it's Korngold who stole the show. Wittgenstein was so happy with this work that he commissioned another piece, a suite for 2 violins, cello and piano left-hand, Op. 23.\\n\\n\\n7. Diversions - Britten\\n\\nLooking at the score, it's hard to believe this explosive piece is written for just one hand. With its cascading quavers and impressive passages jumping across the entire length of the piano, this is the ultimate in left hand piano fireworks - and once again, we have Paul Wittgenstein to thank for its existence.\\n\\n\\n8. Piano Sonata in C Minor - Reinecke\\n\\nWhile Reinecke may not be the most high-profile of composers, his Opus 179 sonata has made its mark on the world of left hand piano music. There's a reason for that: give this a listen for a healthy dose of bombastic, Romantic piano music.\\n\\n9. Six études for the left hand - Saint-Saëns\\n\\nDespite their sheer brilliance, Saint-Saëns' piano études are often overlooked. Every movement requires absolute independence for each individual finger, regardless of hand shape or strength. It's these pieces Ravel studied so diligently when embarking on his left hand piano concerto, and it's easy to see why.\\n\\n10. 4 Special Studies - Reger\\n\\nGerman composer Max Reger brings grace and personality to these cheery piano works, making even the most simple techniques sound impressive. Watch how the left hand trips over the piano with ease, bringing out individual parts across the entire range of the piano.\",\n",

While not serious musicians, his father sang in a choir as a child, and his mother would play the organ.[4] Blais began his musical adventures by \"drumming with pots and pans [and] mix-taping Radio-Canada \"world\" music, traditional, Celtic, [Andean], and Eastern European [music]\".[3]\\n\\nAs a teenager, he took piano lessons, eventually studying at the Trois-Rivières Music Conservatory. However, he found the academic world of music exhausting and restrictive, so he left after two years to travel.[4]\\n\\nHe travelled to Guatemala, spending several months there working at an orphanage.[4] Looking again for a change, he then moved to Berlin for a year, and then went to South America, spending time in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Finally, Blais decided to settle in Montreal, pursuing a career as a special education teacher.[5] He completed a degree in liberal arts with a minor in psychology while focusing his studies on special education. After graduating, he worked with children with disabilities and behavioural disorders for five years at CEGEP level.\\n\\nCareer\\n2016: Il\\nWhile working in special education, Blais slowly rediscovered a fondness for improvising and composing. Blais constructed his debut album, Il, over the course of two years. It was recorded in two days in Blais\\' apartment with a Zoom recorder, allowing the ambience of his apartment to come through on the recording.[4]\\n\\nIf people are going to cough and babies are going to cry, instead of trying to hide it, why not embrace it? I like it when I stop and there\\'s something happening outside my window. I think that\\'s why my music has a lot of pauses and silences, because there\\'s always something happening in the street. I\\'ll let it pass and then continue playing.\\n\\n—\\u2009Jean-Michel Blais in an interview with the Montreal Gazette[6]\\nBlais communicated via Facebook with his friend Devon Bate, credited on the album as BUFFLO, to mix the album. The recording was done in such a manner that the listener feels surrounded by the music.[7] Blais originally released the album via Bandcamp in 2015, where it was discovered by Arts & Crafts, and subsequently given a proper release on 8 April 2016. Arts & Crafts also released the sheet music for the album, along with a deluxe edition featuring two bonus tracks that was released in October 2016.[8] The album was widely acclaimed, ranking 10th on Time Magazine\\'s Top 10 Albums of 2016.[2] Exclaim! gave the album 9/10, writing, \"Simply put, Il is a masterpiece.\"[9]\\n\\n2017: Cascades\\nMichael Silver (a.k.a. CFCF) and Blais first collaborated when the Red Bull Music Academy sponsored a live performance featuring the two artists. Blais and Silver found that they lived around the corner from each other, then started finding similarities in their music and composition style.[10] Cascades features two songs each of their solo works, reworked as a duo, and a cover of John Cage\\'s In a Landscape (1948).\\nI thought [Jean-Michel\\'s music] was beautiful... I just loved it a bunch, especially because it\\'s so different from a lot of the other piano music that I had tended to listen to...\\n\\n—\\u2009Michael Silver (CFCF)\\nCascades was also met with critical acclaim. For Pitchfork, Andy Beta opined that it \"finds Silver and Blais warily feeling one another other out and then synchronizing to exalted effect by the record\\'s end,\" and called the duo\\'s version of \"In a Landscape\", \"one of the most unequivocally gorgeous covers imaginable\".[11] Exclaim! also highlighted Blais and Silver\\'s chemistry, reasoning that \"Blais\\' playing suits very well the pristine and glossy production Silver employed for those recordings, injecting it with a real sense of purpose here,\" giving the album an 8/10.[12]\\n\\n2018: Dans ma main\\nDans ma main is Blais\\' sophomore solo record, released via Arts & Crafts on 11 May 2018. Exclaim! gave the album 9/10 in an early review, writing \"Far from spiralling inward, as always, Blais lets it all flow through him, and as private becomes public, the result is yet another intimate masterpiece\".[13] On the album, he experiments with different synth and electronic textures, a concept introduced to him while working with CFCF.\\n\\nBlais explained in a conversation with CFCF and Red Bull Music Academy, \"I never want to lose contact with the original piano instrument, but we have so many tools now to treat it differently than to just have the instrument on its own, so why not use them, and how? It certainly is opening. It gives me sounds and texture possibilities\".[14] The album was a shortlisted finalist for the 2018 Polaris Music Prize.[15] In August 2019, Blais released an EP of remixes of Dans ma main.[16]\\n\\nEviction Sessions, Matthias & Maxime, and Aubades\\nEviction Sessions is Blais\\' third project, released via Arts & Crafts on 30 November 2018. Eviction Sessions was inspired when Blais was informed he would be evicted from the apartment where he had lived for seven years due to gentrification within his Montreal neighbourhood. This was the same apartment in which Blais recorded his first album of instrumental music, Il. [1]\\n\\nIn October 2019, Blais released the soundtrack to the Canadian film Matthias & Maxime. He received special mention at the Cannes Soundtrack Award in May of the same year.[17]\\n\\nIn February 2022, Blais released the album Aubades.[18] The album won the Félix Award for Instrumental Album of the Year at the 44th Félix Awards; it was also nominated for Bestselling Album of the Year, and Blais was a nominee for Most Successful Artist Outside Quebec.[19]\\n\\nDiscography\\nStudio albums\\n\\nIl (2016)\\nDans ma main (2018)\\nAubades (2022)\\nSoundtracks\\n\\nMatthias & Maxime (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) (2019)\\nEPs\\n\\nCascades with CFCF (2017)\\nEviction Sessions (2018)\\nDans ma main (Remixes) (2019)[20]\\nSingles\\n\\n\"Nostos\" (2016)\\n\"il\" (2016)\\n\"roses\" (2018)\\n\"blind\" (2018)\\n\"forteresse\" (2018)\\n\"outsiders\" (2018)\\nAppearances\\n\\n\"Lullaby\" Playing House (Common Holly, 2017)',\n",

His new album is the first set for the release of Decca imprint Mercury KX.\\n- After Jean-Michel was diagnosed with Tourettes, he found early on that playing music helped alleviate his physical tics. The relationship between his condition and his music has remained strong. For example, he has released an album of electronic/ambient music inspired by the soundscapes his parents used to play him to calm his symptoms. He is working with a hospital in Quebec that is doing pioneering research into Tourrettes. He provides music for their fundraising and community events, drinks wine and discusses the condition with the lead researcher, and plans to host special music concerts designed to give people with Tourettes a safe space to experience music.\\n- He also draws comparisons between Tourrettes, which is often framed as excessive energy that the individual must repress, and the sexual energy he had to repress as a young gay man in a Conservative rural part of Canada.\\n- The new album \\\\_\\\\_aubades\\\\_\\\\_is his first ensemble record, and is named after a French \"goodbye\" morning serenade, which was inspired by a break-up just before lockdown.

When employees are forced either to wait to get answers or to take chances and act independently, time and material resources are wasted through delay and error. This may be especially troublesome in emergencies when time must be devoted to tracking down a missing manager.\\n\\nEmployees should perceive a department manager as the employees’ direct conduit when communicating with other organizational elements. This is especially true for interactions with higher management. Employees may perceive a manager who is not readily visible or available as being uninterested and uncaring. This is true for supervisors who seem dedicated primarily to activities such as meetings, committee work, conferences, and the like that occur outside of a department. Such activities put strain on the relationship between supervisor and employees, and the employees begin to see such a supervisor as indifferent and impersonal. For many members of a working group, their department manager is a representative of the organization itself. This supervisor is the member of management that these employees know best and may be the only member of management with whom they have a speaking relationship. If employees perceive their supervisor as being cold, uncaring, and impersonal, then they are likely to perceive the entire organization in the same manner.

Calculate the velocity of the connecting rod and the load. To do this, you can use the law of cosines to find the length of the connecting rod and the angle between the connecting rod and the horizontal. Then, use the formula for velocity (v = r x w, where r is the radius and w is the angular velocity) to find the velocity of the connecting rod and the load.\\n3. Calculate the acceleration of the connecting rod and the load. To do this, you can use the formula for acceleration (a = r x w^2, where r is the radius and w is the angular velocity) to find the acceleration of the connecting rod and the load.\\n4. Draw the velocity and acceleration diagrams for the crank mechanism. To do this, you can use arrows to represent the velocity and acceleration of the crank, the connecting rod, and the load. Make sure to label each arrow with the corresponding velocity or acceleration value.\\n5. Use the velocity and acceleration diagrams to determine the linear and angular acceleration of the crank mechanism. To do this, you can use the values you calculated in steps 2 and 3, and apply the appropriate formulas (e.g. linear acceleration = tangential acceleration / radius) to find the linear and angular acceleration of the crank mechanism.\\n\\nRemember, the key to drawing velocity and acceleration diagrams is to carefully calculate the velocity and acceleration of each part of the mechanism, and to use arrows to represent these values in your diagrams. By following these steps, you should be able to accurately draw the velocity and acceleration diagrams for a crank mechanism.'},\n",

Over time, the savings from reduced operating and maintenance costs can outweigh the initial investment in renewable energy infrastructure.\\n\\nThirdly, investing in renewable energy can have positive economic benefits, creating new jobs and driving innovation. Renewable energy industries are rapidly growing and creating new employment opportunities in many regions, particularly in rural areas where traditional industries may be in decline. By transitioning to renewable energy sources, we can also reduce our dependence on foreign oil and increase energy security, which can be an important economic and national security consideration.\\n\\nFinally, it's worth considering the economic risks associated with relying solely on traditional fossil fuels. The price of oil and gas can be volatile and subject to sudden price shocks due to geopolitical tensions, supply disruptions, or changes in demand. By diversifying our energy sources and investing in renewable energy, we can reduce our exposure to these risks and create a more stable and resilient energy system that is better equipped to handle unexpected disruptions.\"},\n",

Import the `JWTManager` class from the Flask-JWT library and create an instance of it.\\n3. Define a user model with the necessary fields for authentication, such as a username and password. You can use Flask-SQLAlchemy to define the model.\\n4. Create a route for logging in and authenticating a user. In this route, you can verify the user's credentials and create a JWT token if they are valid.\\n5. Use the `jwt_manager` instance to encode the JWT token with the user's information and return it to the user.\\n6. Create a route for protected resources that require authentication. In this route, use the `jwt_required` decorator provided by the `jwt_manager` instance to protect the route.\\n7. In the protected route, use the `get_jwt_identity` function provided by the `jwt_manager` instance to get the user's information from the JWT token.\\n8. To store invalid tokens, you can create a model in Flask-SQLAlchemy to hold the token and its expiration time. Then, when a user attempts to access a protected resource with an invalid token, you can add the token to this model to prevent them from using it again.\\n\\nHere is an example of how this can be implemented in Flask:\\n```\\n# Import the Flask-JWT library and create an instance of the JWTManager\\nfrom flask_jwt import JWTManager\\njwt_manager = JWTManager()\\n\\n# Define the user model with Flask-SQLAlchemy\\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\\n\\ndb = SQLAlchemy()\\n\\nclass User(db.Model):\\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\\n    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)\\n    password = db.Column(db.String(120), nullable=False)\\n\\n# Set up the Flask app and initialize Flask-SQLAlchemy and Flask-JWT\\napp = Flask(__name__)\\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'SECRET_KEY'\\ndb.init_app(app)\\njwt_manager.init_app(app)\\n\\n# Define a login route that authenticates the user and returns a JWT token\\n@app.route('/login', methods=['POST'])\\ndef login():\\n    username = request.json.get('username')\\n    password = request.json.get('password')\\n\\n    user = User.query.filter_by(username=username).first()\\n\\n    if user and user.password == password:\\n        token = jwt_manager.encode({'id': user.id, 'username': user.username})\\n        return jsonify({'token': token})\\n    else:\\n        return jsonify({'error': 'Invalid credentials'}), 401\\n\\n# Define a model for storing invalid tokens\\nclass InvalidToken(db.Model):\\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\\n    token = db.Column(db.String(255), unique=True, nullable=False)\\n    expiration = db.Column(\\n```\"},\n",

It is a fitness marketplace where trainers and instructors can list the virtual classes that they do use zoom. The platform integrates with zoom. The attendees can search and browse fitness categories, classes, and trainers. They can follow and book free and paid classes. We are competing with the old-school training where you have to go to your local gym. Since it uses Zoom, the trainer can train people from their home, home gym, or studio. And this also allowed the attendee to work out from home just by watching the Zoom class on their laptop or casting it to their TV in any room of their house. The attendee can shut off their webcam if they like. Working out at home has many benefits, such as not having to pay to belong to a gym or drive to a gym. It also removes the embarrassment and anxiety a person can sometimes have when they first join a gym, and they are out of shape, and everyone else is in shape. Working out at home, they can leave the webcam on or off. And for the disabled, obese, or elderly can even participate right from a chair, couch, bed, or rake rests without feeling like they don't belong in the class. This also has many benefits for the trainer too. Instead of driving to a gym and cutting deals with gyms, they can use the site as a social media platform to get thousands or even millions of followers.\\nBut most importantly, if you live in a small rural town in a faraway country, instead of having to serve a small local base of clients, you can now reach millions of people globally, meaning you can use the integrated Zoom platform (Since Fitclass is official partners with Zoom,) to have classes with dozens or even several hundred people. You can charge for classes, but the best thing about our system is our built-in Tips or tipping system. Fitclass encourages our trainers to not have a paywall for their classes or to charge people for their classes. This will limit exposure. By doing classes for Free, it's like Twitch or Youtube live. You, in fact, become a health streamer. You can look at FitClass as a health Streaming Platform. Twitch is for gamers, Youtube live is for content creators, and fitclass.com is for health and wellness professionals to stream their classes live to a global audience and receive real-time tips. Once a person tips, we keep their card on file to make it easy to tip. Just like Youtube has Superthnks for chat tipping and Twitch as Sub tipping, FItclass also has tipping built right into the Zoom app during the training session with our partnership with Zoom. FItclass is free to join for both trainers and attendees. Since the Fitclass platform is free to everyone, it makes money by charging a small nominal service fee on top of classes and taking a small nominal fee from the tips. Among the different classes our trainers can train in are Yoga, Pilates, Cardio Kickboxing, Spinning, Zumba, Body Pump, CrossFit, Bootcamp, Body Combat, Barre, Hot Yoga, TRX, Insanity, P90X, Hot Pilates, Tai Chi, Bikram Yoga, Rowing, Kettlebell, and HIIT.\",\n",

       "  'output': 'Baseline prediction dynamic threshold algorithm is a method to classify data points into two categories based on a threshold value. The threshold value is not fixed and can change based on the distribution of the data points. This algorithm is useful when dealing with imbalanced datasets where one class has a significantly larger number of instances than the other class.\\n\\nThe basic idea behind this algorithm is to set the threshold value to be the mean value of the probability scores of the minority class. Any data point with a probability score higher than the threshold value is classified as belonging to the minority class, otherwise, it is classified as belonging to the majority class.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how to implement the Baseline prediction dynamic threshold algorithm in Python:\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom sklearn.metrics import f1_score\\n\\ndef baseline_dynamic_threshold(y_true, y_pred, minority_class):\\n    # Calculate the probability scores of the minority class\\n    proba = y_pred[:, minority_class]\\n    \\n    # Calculate the mean probability score of the minority class\\n    threshold = np.mean(proba)\\n    \\n    # Classify data points based on the threshold value\\n    y_pred_bin = (proba > threshold).astype(int)\\n    \\n    # Calculate F1-score of the minority class\\n    f1 = f1_score(y_true[:, minority_class], y_pred_bin)\\n    \\n    return y_pred_bin, f1\\n```\\nIn this implementation, `y_true` is the true labels of the data points, `y_pred` is the predicted probability scores of the data points, and `minority_class` is the index of the minority class.

We split the dataset into train and test sets, train a logistic regression model on the train set, and predict the probability scores of the test set. We then apply the `baseline_dynamic_threshold` function to the predicted probability scores and obtain the binary predicted labels and the F1-score of the minority class.

We extract features from the email text using the bag-of-words model and train a GNB classifier on the train set. We use the trained classifier to predict the labels of the test set and evaluate its performance by calculating the accuracy score.\\n\\nNote that GNB assumes that the features are independent and normally distributed, which may not be true for all datasets.

ERP is, in a nutshell, the means of integrating individuals, processes, and technologies throughout a modern business. Obtaining appropriate, trustworthy, and maintainable ERP systems that can be used in businesses while also meeting the functional requirements of the organization, with a level of quality that is acceptable to the organization, is a significant challenge faced by majority of businesses in the country. Since maintainability is a crucial quality characteristic of software applications, ERP systems have occasionally been limited by maintainability issues. The process for predicting the maintainability of ERP software is explicitly described in this research and is based on design metrics and a statistical approach. The study explores if a set of metrics for class diagram structural attributes (size, complexity, coupling, and cohesion) could be useful indicators of class diagram maintainability based on the sub-characteristics of understandability, analyzability, and modifiability. Results show that the measures and recommended metrics can be used to identify the most powerful predictors and build useful prediction models for ERP applications. The statistical data study shows that while database and source code changes have a considerable impact on ERP maintainability quality, module customization has no effect on ERP quality. Our findings have repercussions for how firms implement customized ERP.',\n",

Set up a continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline in GitLab. You can use GitLab's built-in CI/CD tools or a third-party tool like Jenkins or CircleCI. The pipeline should trigger whenever changes are pushed to the repository.\\n2. In the CI/CD pipeline, use a GitLab runner to clone the repository and build the project. You can use a Docker image or other tools as needed.\\n3. Once the project is built, use a deployment tool like Ansible or Terraform to deploy it to the bare metal machine. You can use a configuration file to specify the machine's IP address, credentials, and other details.\\n4. Use a tool like rsync or scp to copy the `docker-compose.yml` file to the machine, and then use `docker-compose` to start the project. This assumes that Docker is already installed on the machine.\\n5. To fetch the `config.json` file and other custom assets, you can use a tool like `wget` or `curl` to download them from a remote location. You can specify the URL in the configuration file or as an environment variable.\\n6. Use a tool like `sed` or `awk` to replace any placeholders in the project's configuration files with values from the `config.json` file or other environment variables.\\n7. Finally, start the project and verify that it's running as expected.\\n\\nThis is just one possible approach, and the specific tools and techniques you use may vary depending on your requirements and preferences.

       "  'output': \"Sure! Here's an example of how Python could be used for fraud detection in banking:\\n\\nOne approach to identifying fraudulent transactions is to look for transactions that are significantly different from the customer's normal spending patterns. For example, a customer who typically spends $50-$100 per transaction might be flagged for fraud if they suddenly make a transaction for $10,000.\\n\\nTo implement this approach in Python, we could use the Pandas library to analyze the customer's transaction history. Here's an example:\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\n\\n# Load transaction data into a Pandas dataframe\\ndf = pd.read_csv('transaction_data.csv')\\n\\n# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of transaction amounts\\nmean_amount = df['amount'].mean()\\nstd_amount = df['amount'].std()\\n\\n# Flag transactions that are more than 3 standard deviations from the mean\\ndf['is_fraud'] = (df['amount'] - mean_amount) > (3 * std_amount)\\n\\n# Save the results to a new CSV file\\ndf.to_csv('fraud_detection_results.csv', index=False)\\n```\\nIn this example, we load the transaction data into a Pandas dataframe and calculate the mean and standard deviation of the transaction amounts. We then use these values to flag transactions that are more than 3 standard deviations from the mean as potentially fraudulent. Finally, we save the results to a new CSV file.\\n\\nOf course, fraud detection is a complex and ever-evolving field, and this is just one simple example of how Python could be used for fraud detection in banking. Other approaches could include using machine learning algorithms to identify patterns in transaction data, or using network analysis to detect unusual patterns of transactions between different accounts.\"},\n",

       "  'output': \"Sure! Here's an example of how Python could be used for customer segmentation in banking:\\n\\nCustomer segmentation involves dividing a bank's customer base into groups based on common characteristics, such as age, income, or account activity. This can help banks tailor their products and services to the needs of specific customer groups, and target their marketing efforts more effectively.\\n\\nTo implement customer segmentation in Python, we can use clustering algorithms to identify groups of customers with similar characteristics. For example, we might use k-means clustering to group customers based on their account activity, such as the number of transactions per month and the average transaction amount.\\n\\nHere's an example script that could perform customer segmentation:\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport numpy as np\\nfrom sklearn.cluster import KMeans\\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\\n# Load customer data into a Pandas dataframe\\ndf = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv')\\n\\n# Select features to be used for clustering\\nX = df[['transactions_per_month', 'avg_transaction_amount']].values\\n\\n# Scale the data\\nscaler = StandardScaler()\\nX_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)\\n\\n# Perform k-means clustering\\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42)\\nkmeans.fit(X_scaled)\\n\\n# Assign cluster labels to each customer\\ndf['cluster'] = kmeans.labels_\\n\\n# Plot the clusters\\nplt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_)\\nplt.xlabel('Transactions per month')\\nplt.ylabel('Average transaction amount')\\nplt.show()\\n\\n# Save the results to a new CSV file\\ndf.to_csv('customer_segments.csv', index=False)\\n```\\nIn this example, we load the customer data into a Pandas dataframe and select the features we want to use for clustering. We then scale the data using StandardScaler to ensure that each feature has equal weight in the clustering process. Next, we use the k-means clustering algorithm to group customers into three clusters based on their account activity. Finally, we plot the clusters using Matplotlib and save the results to a new CSV file.\\n\\nOf course, customer segmentation is a complex and multifaceted field, and this is just one simple example of how Python could be used for customer segmentation in banking. Other approaches could include using decision trees or neural networks to segment customers based on more complex criteria, or using natural language processing to analyze customer feedback and identify common themes.\"},\n",

This might involve analyzing data on loan amounts, interest rates, default rates, and other factors.\\n\\nTo analyze loan data sourced from a CSV file in Python, we can use the Pandas library to load and manipulate the data, and use data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to explore trends and relationships in the data.\\n\\nHere's an example script that could analyze loan data sourced from a CSV file:\\n```python\\nimport pandas as pd\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\nimport seaborn as sns\\n\\n# Load loan data from a CSV file\\ndf = pd.read_csv('loan_data.csv')\\n\\n# Calculate summary statistics on loan data\\nloan_stats = df.describe()\\n\\n# Plot loan amount distribution\\nplt.hist(df['loan_amount'])\\nplt.title('Loan Amount Distribution')\\nplt.xlabel('Loan Amount')\\nplt.ylabel('Frequency')\\nplt.show()\\n\\n# Plot loan amount vs. interest rate\\nsns.scatterplot(x='loan_amount', y='interest_rate', data=df)\\nplt.title('Loan Amount vs. Interest Rate')\\nplt.show()\\n\\n# Calculate default rate by loan term\\ndefault_rates = df.groupby('loan_term')['default'].mean()\\n\\n# Plot default rate by loan term\\nplt.plot(default_rates.index, default_rates.values)\\nplt.title('Default Rate by Loan Term')\\nplt.xlabel('Loan Term (years)')\\nplt.ylabel('Default Rate')\\nplt.show()\\n```\\nIn this example, we load loan data from a CSV file into a Pandas dataframe and calculate summary statistics on the loan data. We then use Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize the loan amount distribution and the relationship between loan amount and interest rate. Finally, we use Pandas to group the data by loan term and calculate the default rate for each loan term, and then plot the default rate as a function of loan term.\\n\\nOf course, loan departments in banks have many other tasks and responsibilities, and this is just one simple example of how Python could be used to analyze loan data sourced from a CSV file.

The goal of saving is to accumulate funds over time, so that you can use them to meet short-term or long-term financial goals, such as buying a car, paying for a wedding, or building an emergency fund.\\n\\nInvesting: Investing involves using your money to buy assets that have the potential to increase in value over time, such as stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or real estate. The goal of investing is to grow your wealth over time, so that you can achieve long-term financial goals, such as retirement, buying a house, or funding your children's education.\\n\\nThe key difference between saving and investing is the level of risk involved. Saving involves putting your money in low-risk accounts that offer low returns, whereas investing involves taking on more risk in the hopes of earning higher returns over the long run. Additionally, while savings is typically used for short-term goals, investing is generally a long-term strategy.\"},\n",

       "  'output': 'Control Tower Organization and Governance\\n\\nIn order for a control tower to function effectively, it requires a clear organizational structure and governance framework. This section will cover the key elements of control tower organization and governance, including organizational structures and roles, key performance indicators (KPIs), and governance models and best practices.\\n\\nOrganizational Structures and Roles\\n\\nThe organizational structure of a control tower typically includes a team of experts responsible for various functions. These functions may include planning, forecasting, execution, monitoring, and optimization. Each team member plays a critical role in ensuring that the control tower operates smoothly and efficiently.\\n\\nThe control tower team is typically led by a manager who is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the control tower. This manager may report to a senior executive within the organization or to a dedicated governance board. In addition to the manager, the team may include:\\n\\n* Planners: Responsible for developing forecasts and creating plans for the operation of the supply chain.\\n* Execution Experts: Responsible for executing plans and ensuring that everything is on track.\\n* Monitors: Responsible for monitoring the performance of the supply chain and identifying potential issues.\\n* Optimization Experts: Responsible for identifying areas for improvement and implementing changes to optimize the supply chain.\\n\\nKey Performance Indicators (KPIs)\\n\\nKPIs are critical to the success of a control tower. They provide a way to measure performance and identify areas for improvement. Some of the most common KPIs for control towers include:\\n\\n* On-time delivery: This measures the percentage of orders that are delivered on time.\\n* Order accuracy: This measures the percentage of orders that are filled correctly.\\n* Inventory accuracy: This measures the accuracy of inventory levels.\\n* Lead time: This measures the time it takes to fulfill an order.\\n* Cost savings: This measures the amount of cost savings achieved through the operation of the control tower.\\n\\nGovernance Models and Best Practices\\n\\nEffective governance is critical to the success of a control tower. A governance model provides a framework for decision-making, accountability, and oversight. There are several governance models that may be used for a control tower, including:\\n\\n* Centralized Governance: This model involves a centralized team responsible for overseeing the entire supply chain. The team may have representatives from different parts of the organization, but the decision-making authority rests with the centralized team.\\n* Decentralized Governance: This model involves a network of teams responsible for different parts of the supply chain. Each team is responsible for making decisions related to their part of the supply chain, but there is coordination and oversight from a central team.\\n* Hybrid Governance: This model combines elements of both centralized and decentralized governance. There may be a centralized team responsible for overseeing the entire supply chain, but there may also be decentralized teams responsible for specific areas.\\n\\nIn addition to choosing a governance model, there are several best practices that can be used to ensure effective governance of a control tower. These include:\\n\\n* Clearly defined roles and responsibilities: Everyone involved in the control tower should understand their roles and responsibilities, as well as those of other team members.\\n* Regular communication: Communication is critical to the success of a control tower. Team members should communicate regularly to ensure that everyone is on the same page.\\n* Continuous improvement: The control tower should be continuously reviewed and improved to ensure that it is meeting the needs of the organization.\\n* Data-driven decision-making: Decisions should be based on data and analytics, rather than on intuition or guesswork.\\n* Standardization: Standardization of processes and procedures can help ensure consistency and efficiency across the supply chain.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nEffective control tower organization and governance is critical to the success of any supply chain operation. A well-structured control tower team, clear KPIs, and effective governance models and best practices can help ensure that the supply chain operates smoothly and efficiently.

       "  'output': 'Visibility and tracking tools play a critical role in the success of any control tower operation. These tools provide real-time information on the status of goods and shipments, allowing supply chain managers to identify potential bottlenecks and make informed decisions to keep the flow of goods moving smoothly. In this section, we will explore the different types of visibility and tracking tools used in control towers.\\n\\nOne of the most commonly used tools is GPS tracking. GPS tracking allows managers to track the location and movement of goods in real-time, giving them the ability to make changes to transportation routes or schedules if necessary. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is another popular technology that provides visibility into the movement of goods. RFID tags are attached to products and can be read by scanners at various points along the supply chain, providing detailed information about the location and status of goods.\\n\\nIn addition to GPS and RFID, there are other visibility and tracking tools that can be used in control tower operations. These include barcode scanning, EDI (Electronic Data Interchange), and IoT (Internet of Things) sensors. These tools can provide real-time data on inventory levels, production schedules, and transportation routes.\\n\\nAnalytics and reporting tools are equally important in the success of control tower operations. These tools allow managers to make informed decisions based on data-driven insights, improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the supply chain. In this section, we will explore the different types of analytics and reporting tools used in control towers.\\n\\nOne of the most commonly used analytics tools is predictive analytics.

One of the main objectives of a Control Tower is to build a unique relationship with customers by providing them with accurate and timely information, while also anticipating their needs and requirements. This module will explore how Control Tower can work as a rule of thumb to achieve this objective by constantly asking ourselves \"HOW\" do we know, \"WHAT\" do we know and \"WHEN\" do we know. Additionally, we will break it down into seven categories that help in building a unique relationship with customers.\\n\\n1. Visibility\\nThe first step in building a unique relationship with customers is to have complete visibility into their supply chain operations. Control Tower should have access to all the relevant data from the customer\\'s operations, including inventory levels, shipments, and order status. With this information, Control Tower can identify potential issues before they become problems and provide the customer with proactive solutions. It also enables the Control Tower to provide the customer with real-time updates on their operations and ensure timely delivery of goods.\\n2. Communication\\nClear communication is critical to building a unique relationship with customers. Control Tower should have a dedicated point of contact with the customer to ensure effective communication. The communication should be proactive, transparent, and timely. The Control Tower should update the customer regularly on the status of their shipments and any potential issues that may arise.\\n3. Collaboration\\nCollaboration is key to building a unique relationship with customers. Control Tower should work closely with the customer to understand their unique requirements and tailor solutions to meet their needs. The Control Tower should work collaboratively with the customer\\'s suppliers and carriers to ensure seamless operations. It is also essential to engage with the customer\\'s stakeholders, such as sales and marketing teams, to understand their priorities and how the supply chain can support their business objectives.\\n4. Performance Management\\nControl Tower should have a robust performance management system in place to track the customer\\'s supply chain performance continually. The system should provide real-time insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) such as on-time delivery, inventory accuracy, and order accuracy. The Control Tower should use this information to identify areas for improvement and work collaboratively with the customer to implement corrective actions.\\n5. Continuous Improvement\\nControl Tower should always strive for continuous improvement in the customer\\'s supply chain operations. This involves regularly reviewing the KPIs and identifying areas for improvement. The Control Tower should then work with the customer to implement corrective actions and measure the impact of these actions. It is also essential to encourage feedback from the customer and use this feedback to drive continuous improvement.\\n6. Risk Management\\nControl Tower should proactively manage risks to the customer\\'s supply chain operations. This involves identifying potential risks, assessing their impact, and developing contingency plans. The Control Tower should work collaboratively with the customer to implement these plans and ensure minimal disruption to their operations.\\n7. Technology\\nFinally, Control Tower should leverage technology to build a unique relationship with customers. The Control Tower should have a robust technology infrastructure in place to enable real-time data sharing, automated workflows, and predictive analytics. This infrastructure should be flexible enough to accommodate the customer\\'s unique requirements and scalable to support their growth.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nBuilding a unique relationship with customers is critical to the success of a Control Tower. By following these seven categories, Control Tower can ensure complete visibility into the customer\\'s supply chain operations, effective communication, collaboration, performance management, continuous improvement,'},\n",

This exercise is divided into 3 parts : 1) backend filtering funtion and API endpoint (node.js) 2) front-end reusable component to plug and play (javascript, html,css) 3) system design for autocomplete service',\n",
       "  'output': 'Sure, I can help you with that!\\n\\n1. Backend filtering function and API endpoint:\\n\\nTo create a backend filtering function and API endpoint to search hotels by name, you can use Node.js and create an endpoint that accepts a query parameter for the hotel name. You can then use a database to store information about the hotels, and use a query to filter the results based on the name. Here\\'s an example of what the code might look like:\\n```javascript\\nconst express = require(\\'express\\');\\nconst app = express();\\n\\n// Database connection and schema definition here\\n\\napp.get(\\'/hotels\\', async (req, res) => {\\n  const name = req.query.name;\\n  const hotels = await Hotel.find({ name: { $regex: new RegExp(name, \\'i\\') } }).exec();\\n  res.json(hotels);\\n});\\n\\napp.listen(3000, () => console.log(\\'Server running on port 3000\\'));\\n```\\nThis code sets up an Express app with an endpoint at `/hotels` that accepts a query parameter called `name`. It then uses the `Hotel` schema to query the database and find all hotels that match the given name using a case-insensitive regular expression. Finally, it returns the results as JSON.\\n\\n2. Front-end reusable component to plug and play:\\n\\nTo create a front-end component that can be reused to search for hotels by name, you can use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a search bar with an autocomplete feature. Here\\'s an example of what the code might look like:\\n```css\\n<!-- HTML -->\\n\\n<input type=\"text\" id=\"hotel-search\" placeholder=\"Search for a hotel\">\\n\\n<!-- CSS -->\\n\\n#hotel-search {\\n  width: 300px;\\n  padding: 8px;\\n  font-size: 16px;\\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\\n  border-radius: 4px;\\n}\\n\\n.autocomplete-items {\\n  position: absolute;\\n  z-index: 999;\\n  top: 100%;\\n  left: 0;\\n  right: 0;\\n  max-height: 200px;\\n  overflow-y: auto;\\n  border: 1px solid #ccc;\\n  border-top: none;\\n  border-radius: 0 0 4px 4px;\\n}\\n\\n.autocomplete-item {\\n  padding: 8px;\\n  cursor: pointer;\\n  background-color: #fff;\\n}\\n\\n.autocomplete-item:hover {\\n  background-color: #f4f4f4;\\n}\\n\\n.autocomplete-item.active {\\n  background-color: #e9e9e9;\\n}\\n\\n<!-- JavaScript -->\\n\\nconst hotelSearch = document.querySelector(\\'#hotel-search\\');\\nconst autocompleteContainer = document.createElement(\\'div\\');\\nautocompleteContainer.setAttribute(\\'class\\', \\'autocomplete-items\\');\\nhotelSearch.parentNode.appendChild(autocompleteContainer);\\n\\nhotelSearch.addEventListener(\\'input\\', async () => {\\n  const response = await fetch(`/hotels?name=${hotelSearch.value}`);\\n  const hotels = await response.json();\\n\\n  autocompleteContainer.innerHTML = \\'\\';\\n  hotels.forEach(hotel => {\\n    const item = document.createElement(\\'div\\');\\n    item.innerHTML = hotel.name;\\n    item.addEventListener(\\'click\\', () => {\\n      hotelSearch.value = hotel.name;\\n      autocompleteContainer.innerHTML = \\'\\';\\n    });\\n    autocompleteContainer.appendChild(item);\\n  });\\n});\\n\\ndocument.addEventListener(\\'click\\', (event) => {\\n  if (!event.target.matches(\\'#hotel-search\\')) {\\n    autocompleteContainer.innerHTML = \\'\\';\\n  }\\n});\\n```\\nThis code creates an input field with an ID of `hotel-search`, as well as a container for the autocomplete items. It then adds an event listener to the input field that sends a request to the `/hotels` endpoint whenever the input changes, and populates the autocomplete container with the results. Finally, it adds event listeners to the items to update the input field and clear the autocomplete container'},\n",

It uses the `Hotel` model to search for hotels by name using a regular expression pattern, and returns the results as JSON.\\n\\n**routes/hotelRoutes.js**\\n```javascript\\nconst express = require('express');\\nconst hotelController = require('../controllers/hotelController');\\n\\nconst router = express.Router();\\n\\nrouter.get('/hotels', hotelController.searchHotels);\\n\\nmodule.exports = router;\\n```\\nThis code defines a router that maps the hotel search request to the `searchHotels` controller function.\\n\\n**app.js**\\n```javascript\\nconst express = require('express');\\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\\nconst hotelRoutes = require('./routes/hotelRoutes');\\n\\nconst app = express();\\n\\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });\\nmongoose.connection.on('error', console.error.bind(console, 'MongoDB connection error:'));\\n\\napp.use('/api', hotelRoutes);\\n\\napp.listen(3000, () => {\\n  console.log('Server started on port 3000');\\n});\\n```\\nThis code sets up an Express app, connects to a MongoDB database, and mounts the hotel routes at the `/api` path. When a request is made to `/api/hotels`, it is routed to the `searchHotels` controller function, which uses the `Hotel` model to search for hotels by name and return the results as JSON.\\n\\nSeparating the code into these different files makes it easier to maintain and test the different parts of the application independently. It also makes the code more modular and reusable, as the same controller and model code can be used with different routers or in different applications.\"},\n",

       "  'output': \"When dealing with a large number of hotels and a high volume of requests, performance is definitely a crucial consideration for providing a good user experience. Here are some suggestions for how to improve performance in such a scenario:\\n\\n1. Indexing: Make sure that the fields being queried are indexed in the database. For example, in MongoDB you can create an index on the `name` field to speed up queries that use it for filtering. Indexing can greatly improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be scanned.\\n2. Caching: Cache the results of queries that are frequently executed to avoid hitting the database unnecessarily. This can be done using an in-memory cache such as Redis or Memcached. When a request comes in for a query that has been cached, simply return the cached result rather than executing the query again. Caching can significantly reduce the response time for queries.\\n3. Load balancing: Distribute the requests across multiple servers using load balancing. This can be done using a dedicated load balancer such as NGINX or HAProxy, or through a cloud provider's load balancing service. By spreading the load across multiple servers, you can handle more requests and reduce the response time for each request.\\n4. Sharding: If the database is large enough, it may be necessary to shard it to distribute the data across multiple servers. Sharding involves partitioning the data so that each server only holds a portion of the overall dataset. This can improve query performance by reducing the amount of data that needs to be queried on each server. However, sharding is a complex and potentially expensive solution, so it should be considered carefully.\\n5. Asynchronous processing: If there are certain operations that are slow or resource-intensive, consider offloading them to an asynchronous process. For example, if generating metadata for hotels is slow, you could have a separate service that generates metadata asynchronously and stores it in a cache. When a request comes in, you can check the cache for metadata and return it if available, or generate it on the fly if not. This can improve the response time for queries by avoiding slow operations in the critical path.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of ways to improve performance in a high-volume scenario. The exact solution will depend on the specifics of the system and the resources available.\"},\n",

An index is a data structure that maps the values in one or more columns of a table to their physical locations in the database. By creating an index on one or more columns, the database can quickly locate the rows that match a specific value or set of values, without having to scan the entire table.\\n\\nIndexes are especially useful for large tables with many rows, where queries can take a long time to execute. By using an index, the database can reduce the amount of data that needs to be scanned, which can significantly improve query performance.\\n\\nThere are several types of indexes, including:\\n\\n1. B-tree index: This is the most common type of index, which uses a tree data structure to organize the data.\\n2. Hash index: This type of index uses a hash function to map the values to their physical locations.\\n3. Bitmap index: This type of index uses a bitmap to represent the presence or absence of values in a column.\\n\\nIndexes can be created on one or more columns of a table, depending on the type of queries that will be performed. However, creating too many indexes can also have a negative impact on performance, since it can slow down data insertion and updates, and require more storage space.\\n\\nIn summary, indexing is an important technique for optimizing database performance and improving query speed, but it requires careful consideration and planning to ensure that it is used effectively.'},\n",

It allows clients to define the structure of the data that they need, and the server will return exactly that data, and nothing more. GraphQL has some key differences compared to REST:\\n\\n1. Query language: GraphQL uses its own query language to describe the data that is needed, while REST relies on HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and endpoints to perform operations.\\n2. Flexible responses: GraphQL allows clients to specify exactly what data they want to retrieve, which means that responses can be tailored to the needs of each client. With REST, responses are generally static and fixed for all clients.\\n3. Single endpoint: GraphQL uses a single endpoint for all queries, while REST uses multiple endpoints for different resources.\\n4. Type system: GraphQL has a built-in type system that allows clients and servers to define the structure of the data that is being exchanged, making it easier to validate requests and responses.\\n5. Relationships: GraphQL allows clients to request data from multiple resources in a single query, making it easy to traverse complex relationships between resources. With REST, this often requires multiple requests.\\n6. Caching: Because GraphQL queries are structured, they can be easily cached, which can improve performance for clients. With REST, caching is often more difficult, especially when dealing with dynamic resources.\\n\\nOverall, GraphQL provides a more flexible and efficient way to build APIs compared to REST, especially when dealing with complex and dynamic data structures.

For example, there could be a situation where a supernatural occurrence defies conventional explanations, and Alex must rely on her mother\\'s spiritual teachings to make sense of it. This conflict will be a recurring theme, allowing her character to grow and evolve over time.\\n2. As Heather\\'s powers develop, we can introduce new abilities and challenges for her character.

Jasmine\\'s journey will be about opening up to others, learning to trust, and finding strength in her relationships with the group. Her growing bond with the other characters can be a source of emotional depth for the series.\\n5. For episodic storylines, we can explore themes such as punishment and forgiveness, modernity, struggle with authority, class awareness, and authenticity. Here are a few potential storylines that incorporate these themes:\\n* A vengeful ghost seeks retribution for a past injustice, forcing the group to confront themes of punishment and forgiveness.\\n* The facility\\'s new management implements advanced surveillance technology, creating an atmosphere of control and distrust that the teens must navigate.\\n* A series of mysterious events at Los Padrinos reveals a hidden connection to a powerful figure in the community, highlighting themes of class and authority.\\n* The group uncovers evidence of a decades-old cover-up involving the facility\\'s dark past, questioning the authenticity of the new management\\'s progressive image.\\n\\nTo balance the larger narrative arc with episodic storylines, we can use a structure similar to shows like \"X-Files\" and \"Supernatural.\" Each episode will feature a self-contained mystery, while also dropping hints and clues that connect to the overarching story of the Devil\\'s Den and Alex\\'s sister\\'s disappearance.

The most commonly used dice in Dungeons and Dragons are a 20-sided die (d20), a 12-sided die (d12), a 10-sided die (d10), an 8-sided die (d8), a 6-sided die (d6), and a 4-sided die (d4).\\n\\nIn addition to rolling dice, characters have abilities, skills, and spells that they can use to interact with the game world. Each character has a set of attributes, such as strength, dexterity, and intelligence, that define their capabilities and limitations.\\n\\nThe rules of Dungeons and Dragons are quite complex, and there are many books and resources available that provide detailed information on character creation, combat, magic, and other aspects of the game. If you have specific questions about the rules of Dungeons and Dragons, I'd be happy to try to answer them for you.\"},\n",

       "  'output': \"To track the player's hips, you can use the position and rotation data of the VR headset and controllers to estimate the position of the hips. Here are a few steps you could follow to accomplish this:\\n\\n1. Identify the approximate position of the hips relative to the headset and controllers. You can do this by examining the player's body movements and determining where the hips are likely to be located in relation to the other tracked points.\\n2. Use the position and rotation data from the headset and controllers to estimate the position of the hips. One way to do this is to use inverse kinematics (IK), which is a technique used in animation and robotics to determine the joint angles required to achieve a specific end position. In this case, you can use IK to determine the position of the hips based on the known positions of the headset and controllers.\\n3. Refine the estimated position of the hips based on additional information. For example, you may be able to use machine learning algorithms to learn patterns in the player's movements and use that information to improve the accuracy of the estimated hip position.\\n4. Continuously update the estimated position of the hips based on the incoming position and rotation data from the headset and controllers. This will help ensure that the estimated hip position remains accurate even as the player moves around and changes positions.\\n\\nOverall, accurately tracking the position of the hips can be a challenging problem, but using a combination of techniques such as IK and machine learning can help you approximate the position of the hips with a reasonable degree of accuracy.\"},\n",

Available options are augmenting httpd's configuration or replacing it with a new (open source) Linux software LB. Traffic is <100 reqs/sec and less than 2MB/sec, latency is not an issue.\\nHaving a software engineering background my instinct is to program an LB of my own and be done, but supporting that would require upskilling my team (who are not software engineers).

Using Nginx: Nginx is a popular open source web server that also has a load balancing module. Nginx can be configured to inspect response headers and modify the load balancing algorithm accordingly.

       "  'output': 'Part 1: Introduction to Linux\\n\\nLinux is an open-source operating system that is widely used in servers, supercomputers, and embedded devices. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a Unix-like operating system and has since become one of the most popular operating systems in the world.\\n\\nLinux is known for its stability, security, and flexibility. It is open-source, which means that anyone can view and modify the source code. This has led to a community-driven development model, where thousands of developers contribute to the codebase, fix bugs, and add new features.\\n\\nThere are many different distributions, or versions, of Linux, including Ubuntu, Fedora, Debian, and CentOS. Each distribution has its own set of default software packages, package management system, and user interface. Some distributions are designed for specific use cases, such as server deployment or multimedia production.\\n\\nOne of the biggest advantages of Linux is its stability. Linux systems are known to run for years without needing to be rebooted, which makes them ideal for servers and other critical systems. Linux is also very secure, with a robust set of built-in security features and a large community of security experts who actively work to identify and fix vulnerabilities.\\n\\nLinux is also very flexible. It can run on a wide range of hardware platforms, from small embedded devices to massive supercomputers. It can also be customized to meet specific needs, with users able to choose from a vast array of software packages and desktop environments.\\n\\nBasic Linux commands are essential for anyone using Linux. These include cd (change directory), ls (list files and directories), mkdir (create a new directory), touch (create a new file), and many others. These commands allow users to navigate the file system, create and manage files and directories, and perform various other tasks.\\n\\nThe file system hierarchy in Linux is organized in a hierarchical structure. The root directory (/) is at the top of the hierarchy, and all other directories are subdirectories of the root directory. The most commonly used directories include /home (user home directories), /usr (user programs), and /etc (system configuration files).\\n\\nInstalling Linux can be done in several ways, including dual-booting, where Linux is installed alongside another operating system on the same computer, or using a virtual machine, where Linux is installed as a guest operating system inside another operating system. There are also many different installation methods, depending on the distribution being used.'},\n",

Here is the full Markdown documentation for the Kubernetes installation and deployment:\\n```markdown\\n# Kubernetes Installation and Deployment Guide\\n\\nThis guide will walk you through the process of installing and deploying a Kubernetes cluster. It is assumed that you have a basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts and architecture.\\n\\n## Prerequisites\\n\\nBefore you begin, you should have the following:\\n\\n- A Linux-based system (Ubuntu 16.04 or higher is recommended)\\n- Docker (version 1.12 or higher)\\n- kubeadm (version 1.12 or higher)\\n- kubectl (version 1.12 or higher)\\n- A minimum of 2 GB of RAM per machine in your cluster\\n\\n## Step 1: Install Docker\\n\\nDocker is a container runtime used by Kubernetes. To install Docker on your system, run the following commands:\\n```\\nsudo apt-get update\\nsudo apt-get install -y docker.io\\n```vbnet\\n\\nOnce Docker is installed, start the Docker daemon and enable it to start on boot:\\n```\\nsudo systemctl start docker\\nsudo systemctl enable docker\\n```vbnet\\n\\n## Step 2: Install kubeadm and kubectl\\n\\nKubeadm is a tool used to bootstrap Kubernetes clusters. Kubectl is a command-line tool used to manage Kubernetes clusters. To install kubeadm and kubectl, run the following commands:\\n```\\nsudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https curl\\ncurl -s <https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg> | sudo apt-key add -\\necho \"deb <https://apt.kubernetes.io/> kubernetes-xenial main\" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list\\nsudo apt-get update\\nsudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl\\n```bash\\n\\n## Step 3: Initialize the Kubernetes Cluster\\n\\nTo initialize a Kubernetes cluster, run the following command on the master node:\\n```\\nsudo kubeadm init\\n```vbnet\\n\\nThis will take several minutes to complete. Once it is finished, you should see a message that looks something like this:\\n```\\nYour Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!\\n\\nTo start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:\\n\\nmkdir -p $HOME/.kube\\nsudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config\\nsudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config\\n```javascript\\n\\nCopy the `mkdir` command and run it to create the `.kube` directory:\\n```\\nmkdir -p $HOME/.kube\\n```go\\n\\nThen, copy the `cp` and `chown` commands to copy the Kubernetes configuration file to the `.kube` directory:\\n```\\nsudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config\\nsudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config\\n```vbnet\\n\\n## Step 4: Join Worker Nodes to the Cluster\\n\\nTo join worker nodes to the Kubernetes cluster, run the following command on each worker node:\\n```\\nsudo kubeadm join <master-node-ip>:<master-node-port> --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash <hash>\\n```javascript\\n\\nReplace `<master-node-ip>` and `<master-node-port>` with the IP address and port of your Kubernetes master node, respectively. Replace `<token>` and `<hash>` with the token and certificate hash provided by the `kubeadm init` command.\\n\\n## Step 5: Verify Installation\\n\\nTo verify that your Kubernetes cluster is running correctly, run the following command on the master node:\\n```\\nkubectl get nodes\\n```python\\n\\nYou should see the master node and any worker nodes you have added to the cluster listed.\\n\\n## Step\\n```'},\n",

       "  'output': 'Sure, the process to achieve the same thing in Bitbucket is very similar to Github. Bitbucket has its own version of GitHub Actions called Bitbucket Pipelines.\\n\\nHere\\'s how you can automate the process of converting a Markdown document to a Confluence page and generating a mindmap file in Bitbucket Pipelines:\\n\\n1. Create a `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file in the root of your repository.\\n2. Define the pipeline by specifying the image to use for the build, and the steps to run. Here\\'s an example:\\n```yaml\\npipelines:\\n  default:\\n    - step:\\n        name: Convert Markdown to Confluence\\n        image: atlassian/confluence-cli\\n        script:\\n          - confluence --action=login --user=$USERNAME --password=$PASSWORD --server=$CONFLUENCE_SERVER\\n          - confluence --action=storePage --title=\"$CONFLUENCE_PAGE_TITLE\" --space=\"$CONFLUENCE_SPACE\" --content=\"$(cat mydocument.md)\" --parent=\"$CONFLUENCE_PARENT_PAGE_TITLE\"\\n    - step:\\n        name: Generate Mindmap\\n        image: openjdk:11\\n        script:\\n          - apt-get update && apt-get install -y graphviz\\n          - chmod +x generate-mindmap.sh\\n          - ./generate-mindmap.sh > mindmap.dot\\n          - dot -Tpng mindmap.dot -o mindmap.png\\n        artifacts:\\n          - mindmap.png\\n```\\n3. In the first step of the pipeline, we are using the `atlassian/confluence-cli` Docker image to log in to Confluence and store the Markdown file as a Confluence page. You\\'ll need to set the `USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`, `CONFLUENCE_SERVER`, `CONFLUENCE_PAGE_TITLE`, `CONFLUENCE_SPACE`, and `CONFLUENCE_PARENT_PAGE_TITLE` environment variables for this to work.\\n4. In the second step of the pipeline, we are using the `openjdk:11` Docker image to install the Graphviz package and generate the mindmap file. We assume that you have a `generate-mindmap.sh` script that generates the mindmap. The script should output the mindmap in DOT format, which we convert to a PNG file using the `dot` command. The resulting PNG file is then uploaded as an artifact.\\n5. Finally, commit and push the `bitbucket-pipelines.yml` file to your repository, and the pipeline will be automatically triggered.\\n\\nThat\\'s it! With this pipeline, you can automate the process of converting your Markdown documents to Confluence pages and generating mindmaps whenever you push changes to your repository.'},\n",

       "  'output': \"Sure, here's a summary of the steps involved in automating the documentation process for your shell script:\\n\\n1. Store your shell script in a Git repository such as Github or Bitbucket.\\n2. Create a Dockerfile to build a container image that installs the required dependencies for converting Markdown to Confluence format and generating a mind map. This Dockerfile should include the necessary commands to install the required software packages, such as pandoc and graphviz.\\n3. Use the Serverless Framework to define and deploy an AWS Lambda function that uses the Docker image as a runtime. This function will accept an input variable that specifies the location of the shell script file to be processed.\\n4. Create an API Gateway endpoint that triggers the Lambda function using an HTTP POST request. This endpoint will be the public-facing URL that your users will access to run the script.\\n5. To convert the Markdown file to Confluence format, the Lambda function will use the pandoc software package to convert the Markdown file to HTML format, and then use the Confluence REST API to upload the resulting HTML to the desired Confluence page.\\n6. To generate a mind map of the shell script, the Lambda function will use the Graphviz package to generate a DOT file from the script code and then convert the DOT file to a PNG image.\\n7. The Lambda function will return the resulting Confluence page URL and the mind map image URL to the API Gateway endpoint, which will pass the response back to the user.\\n\\nOverall, this process involves creating a Docker container that includes all the necessary software packages and dependencies, using the Serverless Framework to deploy the container as an AWS Lambda function, and creating an API Gateway endpoint to trigger the function via an HTTP POST request. The Lambda function then uses various software packages to convert the Markdown file to Confluence format and generate a mind map of the shell script, and returns the resulting URLs to the user.\"},\n",

It is a quality that we all need to develop, especially in today's world where we are constantly faced with diverse perspectives and experiences.\\n\\nEmpathy is not just a feel-good emotion, but it is an essential part of building strong relationships and creating a positive community. When we practice empathy, we become more tolerant, understanding, and respectful towards others. We learn to appreciate the differences that make us unique and diverse.\\n\\nEmpathy is particularly important in schools. As students, we are constantly interacting with our peers, teachers, and other members of the school community. We come from different backgrounds, cultures, and experiences, and we all have our own challenges and struggles. By practicing empathy, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment where everyone feels heard and understood.\\n\\nBut empathy is not just about understanding and sharing other people's emotions; it is also about taking action to help them. When we see someone struggling or in pain, we should not just sympathize with them but also try to help in any way we can. Whether it's offering a listening ear, providing support or advocating for them, our actions can make a significant difference in someone's life.\\n\\nIn conclusion, empathy is a crucial quality that we should all strive to develop.

       "  'output': \"Sure, here are some Node.js technical questions and answers you can ask during an interview:\\n\\n1. What is Node.js, and what are its benefits?\\nAnswer: Node.js is a server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. The benefits of using Node.js include its ability to handle a large number of simultaneous connections, its fast performance, and its scalability.\\n2. What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Node.js?\\nAnswer: Synchronous programming in Node.js means that the code execution is blocked until the task is completed, while asynchronous programming means that the code continues to run while the task is being completed. Asynchronous programming is more efficient in Node.js as it allows for non-blocking I/O operations.\\n3. What is the event loop in Node.js, and how does it work?\\nAnswer: The event loop is a key feature of Node.js that allows it to handle multiple requests simultaneously. It works by constantly monitoring the Node.js environment for new events such as I/O operations or incoming requests. When an event occurs, the event loop sends it to a callback function to be processed.\\n4. What are the core modules in Node.js, and how do you use them?\\nAnswer: Core modules in Node.js are built-in modules that you can use without installing any additional packages. Examples include the HTTP module for creating web servers, the File System module for working with files, and the Path module for working with file paths. You can use these modules by requiring them at the beginning of your code file.\\n5. How do you handle errors in Node.js?\\nAnswer: In Node.js, errors can be handled using try-catch blocks or by using the error event. You can also use the built-in assert module to write unit tests that check for errors. Additionally, many third-party packages provide their own error-handling mechanisms.\\n6. What is the difference between require() and import in Node.js?\\nAnswer: require() is a CommonJS module system used in Node.js to load modules, while import is part of the ES6 module system. require() is a synchronous operation, while import is asynchronous. Additionally, import allows for more granular control over what is imported, while require() imports the entire module.\\n7. How do you handle CORS in Node.js?\\nAnswer: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is handled in Node.js using middleware such as cors or helmet. These packages allow you to specify which domains are allowed to access your server's resources, preventing unauthorized access. Additionally, you can set headers in your server's response to indicate that CORS is allowed.\\n\\nI hope these questions and answers help you prepare for your Node.js interview!\"},\n",

What is ECMAScript?\\nAnswer: ECMAScript is a scripting language specification that is standardized by the ECMA International organization. It is the basis for several popular programming languages, including JavaScript, and provides the syntax and semantics for the language.\\n2. What is the difference between var, let, and const in ECMAScript?\\nAnswer: var is the oldest variable declaration keyword in JavaScript and has function scope, while let and const were introduced in ECMAScript 6 and have block scope. The main difference between let and const is that const variables cannot be reassigned, while let variables can.\\n3. What is arrow function syntax in ECMAScript?\\nAnswer: Arrow function syntax is a shorthand syntax for declaring functions in ECMAScript. It uses the => operator to separate the function parameters from the function body, like this:\\n```javascript\\nconst myFunction = (parameter1, parameter2) => {\\n  // function body\\n}\\n```\\n1. What are template literals in ECMAScript?\\nAnswer: Template literals are a new syntax for creating strings in ECMAScript 6. They use backticks (`) to delimit the string, and allow for string interpolation and multiline strings, like this:\\n```csharp\\nconst myVariable = \"world\";\\nconst myString = `Hello, ${myVariable}!\\nThis is a multiline string.`;\\n```\\n1. What are the new data types introduced in ECMAScript 6?\\nAnswer: ECMAScript 6 introduced two new data types: Symbol and Map. Symbols are unique, immutable values that can be used as object keys, while Maps are collections of key-value pairs that allow any type of data as keys.\\n\\nI hope these ECMA script questions and answers help you prepare for your interview!'},\n",

Sign up for a Google Maps API key: You\\'ll need a Google Maps API key in order to use the Google Maps API in your application. You can sign up for a key on the Google Maps API website.\\n2.

Add markers for the property listings: To add markers for the property listings on the map, you\\'ll need to create a new Google Maps marker for each listing and add it to the map. Here\\'s an example:\\n```php\\n<script>\\n  function initMap() {\\n    const mapContainer = document.getElementById(\"map\");\\n    const mapOptions = {\\n      center: { lat: 37.7749, lng: -122.4194 },\\n      zoom: 8\\n    };\\n    const map = new google.maps.Map(mapContainer, mapOptions);\\n\\n    const propertyListings = [\\n      {\\n        title: \"Property Listing 1\",\\n        location: { lat: 37.788022, lng: -122.399797 }\\n      },\\n      {\\n        title: \"Property Listing 2\",\\n        location: { lat: 37.7516, lng: -122.4477 }\\n      }\\n    ];\\n\\n    propertyListings.forEach(propertyListing => {\\n      const marker = new google.maps.Marker({\\n        position: propertyListing.location,\\n        map: map,\\n        title: propertyListing.title\\n      });\\n    });\\n  }\\n  initMap();\\n</script>\\n```\\nThis is just a basic example of how you could show the property listings on a map using the Google Maps API.

We then define the window size and overlap parameters for STFT. We use the `signal.stft` function from the `scipy` library to apply STFT to the time series. This function returns the frequency array `f`, the time array `t`, and the complex STFT array `Zxx`. We take the absolute value of `Zxx` to obtain the spectrogram.\\n\\nFinally, we plot the spectrogram using the `pcolormesh` function from the `matplotlib` library. The `vmin` and `vmax` parameters are used to set the color scale. We also add labels for the frequency and time axes and a colorbar to indicate the color scale. The resulting plot shows the time-varying frequency content of the financial time series.\"},\n",

       "  'output': \"Certainly! During the stable storage period in controlled atmosphere (CA) storage, the respiration rates of apples stabilize at a lower level due to the environmental conditions created in the storage facility. This stable period is achieved after the apples have gone through the initial acclimation period and adapted to the new environment.\\n\\nThe lower respiration rate is primarily a result of the following factors:\\n\\n1. Lower oxygen levels: In CA storage, oxygen levels are deliberately reduced, typically to around 1-5%. This reduction in oxygen availability slows down the respiration process, as oxygen is essential for the conversion of stored energy (carbohydrates) into usable energy for the apples. With less oxygen available, the respiration rate decreases.\\n2. Higher carbon dioxide levels: CA storage facilities also have increased carbon dioxide levels, usually in the range of 1-5%. Elevated carbon dioxide concentrations can further suppress the respiration rate in apples. This is because high carbon dioxide levels inhibit the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of stored carbohydrates, thus slowing down the respiration process.\\n3. Lower temperatures: In CA storage, apples are kept at cooler temperatures, typically between 32°F (0°C) and 40°F (4°C). These lower temperatures slow down the metabolic processes, including respiration. As a result, the apples' cellular activities are reduced, which helps preserve their quality and extend their shelf life.\\n\\nBy maintaining these specific environmental conditions, the respiration rate of apples stabilizes at a lower level than in a regular atmospheric environment. This stable, reduced respiration rate helps slow down the ripening and aging process, allowing apples to be stored for a longer period without significant loss in quality or freshness.\"},\n",

Here's an outline of the steps you can follow to create a similar combat system in Unreal Engine 5:\\n\\n1. Set up a new project: Start by creating a new project in Unreal Engine 5 and selecting the appropriate settings for your project. You can choose the Third-Person template to get started.\\n2. Create character assets: You will need to create and import character models, animations, and rigging into Unreal Engine. You can use the Marketplace or create them from scratch using programs like Maya or Blender.\\n3. Set up character blueprint: Create a blueprint for your character, which will contain all the logic and code for your character's movements, animations, and combat abilities. You can start by creating variables for things like health, damage, speed, and attack speed.\\n4. Create animations: Use the animation tool in Unreal Engine to create animations for your character's movements, attacks, and other abilities. You can also import animations if you have them already created.\\n5. Implement basic movement: Use the CharacterMovement component to implement basic movement for your character, such as walking, running, and jumping. You can use the built-in functions in Unreal Engine to control the character's movement based on player input.\\n6. Implement combat mechanics: Use blueprints and C++ code to implement combat mechanics, such as attacking, blocking, and taking damage. You can use collision boxes and ray casts to detect when the character is in range to attack an enemy and when it is taking damage.\\n7. Create enemy AI: Create AI for your enemies using blueprints and C++ code. You can use behavior trees and blackboards to control the enemy's behavior and decision-making.\\n8. Create elemental interactions: Create a system to handle elemental interactions between your character and the enemies, such as the ability to freeze or burn enemies. You can use particle systems and audio components to create visual and auditory feedback when these interactions occur.\\n9. Implement abilities: Create blueprints and C++ code to implement abilities for your character, such as a healing ability, an ultimate ability, and passive abilities. You can use the same techniques used for combat mechanics to create these abilities.\\n10. Test and refine: Test your combat system and refine it as necessary. You can use Unreal Engine's built-in debugging tools to help you identify and fix any issues.\\n\\nThis is a general outline of the steps required to create a combat system like Genshin Impact in Unreal Engine 5. Keep in mind that this is a complex process and may require a good understanding of programming and game development.

A lambda can capture variables from the surrounding scope, allowing it to use values from the context where it was defined. The capture can be done either by value or by reference.\\n\\nHere's an example of a simple lambda in C++:\\n```java\\nauto myLambda = [] (int x, int y) -> int {\\n    return x + y;\\n};\\n\\nint result = myLambda(2, 3);  // result is now 5\\n```\\nIn this example, we define a lambda that takes two integers as arguments and returns their sum. We use the `auto` keyword to let the compiler deduce the return type, and we specify the types of the arguments in the parameter list. The `-> int` part after the parameter list specifies the return type.\\n\\nWe then call the lambda with arguments `2` and `3` and assign the result to a variable `result`.\\n\\nLambdas can be used in many different contexts, such as sorting algorithms, event handling, and more.

       " {'instruction': \"Please write this in the style of Hemingway: Looking out from the nest of this osprey HAWK family on a bright sunny morning Joey watched as a group of EAGLES fished off of a gleaming white sand bar gently lapped by blu-ish green waters of the bay. The EAGLES fluttered, hopped and scurried about in the bubbly white surf, their chatter and song filling the tropical sea air and Joey’s young mind. \\n\\nJoey was about the same age as the youthful EAGLES out there on the sand bar. Those EA-GLES had dark feathers like Joey as they had not developed the white head and tail feathers of the older bald EAGLES. Joey did not look at all like Livie, his brightly colored osprey sister who was older than Joey. \\n\\nJoey felt a gentle morning breeze as he looked out along his broad wings colored dark grey with white mottling. The breeze raised up the ends of the contour feathers along the leading edge of Joey’s wings and slightly ruffled his long wing tip primary feathers. Joey wondered if his wings would sustain his flight on great thermal air currents on his dream to soar all the way up to the top of the sky.\\n\\nAfter noontime Joey watched as the EAGLES lifted slowly upward in flapping flight high above their bay world of sand, sea, and tropical keys until they were soaring on warm upwelling thermal currents. With their wings fully outstretched they spiraled higher and higher upward.\\n\\nAs Joey watched the EAGLES with intense admiration they slowly soared through misty white vapor into a billowing and radiant cumulus cloud that floated above in the vast ocean of blue sky. Then all of the EAGLES disappeared into the cloud. \\n\\nJoey's head swam with dizzying visions of soaring way up there into white towering clouds. \\n\\n“One day soon I will surely soar to the top of the sky like those EAGLES,” thought Joey.\\n\\nThen Joey heard a rushing and fluttering of wing feathers and turned his head to see a long-winged bird turn into the wind and level out on a glide directly toward him. With its great wings fully outstretched and its tail fanned and lowered, this winsomely white bird cut a strik-ing figure as it loomed upon the nest. \\n\\nThe great bird stretched its head and long white legs with taloned feet forward and raised its wings up and back with long primary feathers splayed. The bird seized onto a thick branch at the edge of the nest and tipped forward unstably. Then it quickly rotated its wings revealing a distinctive bold patterning of brown and black across their undersides as the bird recovered to an upright position. \\n\\n“Ahoy there my little avian predator!” exclaimed the bird as she folded her long wings and set-tled into a resting position at the edge of the nest. \\n\\n“Hello Livie,” replied Joey still crouched in the thicket of the large protective nest.\\n\\n“And what kind of day is our youngest raptor having?” asked Joey’s sister Livie. \\n\\n“I have been watching the EAGLES, Livie,” replied Joey. “They were fishing, playing, and sunning out there on that sand bar and the key just beyond it. Then the EAGLES went soaring right up into those clouds.” \\n\\n“I want to soar up there to the top of the sky!” exclaimed Joey. “Would you like to go soaring with me, Livie?”\\n\\n“Sure Joey, in a while,” replied Livie. \\n\\nThen Joey began dragging a favorite stick across the nest bed. \\n\\n“You’re such a kid Joey!” exclaimed Livie as she hopped down into the nest and grabbed the other end of the stick with her bill engaging Joey in a friendly game of tug of war. \\n\\nJoey pulled his stick free from Livie's grasp and won the tug. Then Livie picked up a tuft of grass from the nest bed and playfully tossed it at Joey. \\n\\n“Oh Joey I remember you always romping and playing on the nest with some odd shaped sticks and sea shells,” said Livie. “Those were some of your favorite toys and you would spend count-less hours leaping upon them, pecking at them, caressing them, tossing them into the air and then catching them with your feet before they hit the nest.“\\n\\n“I know that Livie, but now I just want to go soaring. Will you go soaring with me?” asked Jo-ey.\\n\\n“All right Joey you’re on!” shouted Livie as she began flapping her wings and lifted off sky-ward.\\n\\n“That’s great!” exclaimed Joey, as he began flapping his wings and lifted off from the nest. Jo-ey heard the song of the heart rushing through his mind as the world became smaller below. \\n\\nBy now the clouds boiling up above the bay were indicating strong thermals in a sky laden with moisture which was energizing the thermals. The clouds were growing larger, bubbling and bursting upward with great speed. \\n\\nJoey and his sister Livie lifted up on broad wings high above their tropical nest key until they were soaring on wide upwelling thermal currents. They flapped and soared in the direction of some brilliant white clouds.\\n\\nAs Livie and Joey flew through shadows cast down below the clouds they felt the rush of ther-mal currents that were feeding into the growing cumulus clouds. \\n\\nWith their wings fully outstretched now Livie and Joey spiraled higher and higher until their nest key was just a small but shining emerald among the many green keys sprinkled off the southern tip of the Everglades across Florida Bay. \\n\\nAs they continued to soar upward on strong thermal currents, Livie and Joey headed toward a developing cumulus cloud that was billowing out in front of some darker clouds. \\n\\nAs the two youngsters approached the cloud, Joey exclaimed: “Wow, look at the top of that cloud bursting upwards!”\\n\\n“I see it Joey,” replied Livie.\\n\\nThe warm air currents were rushing up beneath their wings as Livie and Joey entered gray mist at the base of the cloud. “Don’t stiffen up! Stay relaxed Joey!” shouted Livie. \\n\\nThey soared through misty vapor into the billowing and radiant cumulus cloud. \\n\\n“Sharpen your turn and stay within the up draft!” shouted Livie as the strong thermal pushed them upward. \\n\\nJoey felt the exhilaration of the warm air pushing up under his wing and body feathers. Then he was jolted by a strong gust which ruffled his long wing-tip primary feathers and thrust up the ends of the contour feathers along the leading edge of his wings. \\n\\n“This is awesome!” yelled Joey as the thermal current pushed them higher and higher inside the cloud. \\n\\nBy now Joey could see feelers of lightening branching off in all directions above them. \\n\\nThen Joey and Livie were buffeted by strong wind turbulence inside the great cloud which tossed them around. \\n\\nJoey felt muscles and tendons straining and saw feathers bending out along his wings as he tried to recover stable flight. \\n\\nThe shearing winds of a down draft slammed into Joey pushing him downward. \\nThen strong gusts superimposed upon the down draft tossed Joey upside down. \\n\\n“I’m out of control!” thought Joey as fear clouded his mind. \\n\\nBrilliant light surrounded Joey as he was thrust out the side of the great cumulus cloud.\\n\\n“Wow that was the greatest experience of my life!” shouted Joey as he looked around.

There sat Livie perched on a branch above their nest overlooking the grassy green meadow at the center of the key. Joey flew directly toward her and alighted onto the nest. \\n\\n“How did you get back here so fast Livie?” asked Joey. \\n\\n“I tumbled and turned every which way right out the side of the cloud!” exclaimed Livie. \\n\\n“That’s exactly what happened to me and I loved it!” exclaimed Joey. “I want to soar even higher into the greatest cloud next time!” \\n\\n“Oh Joey you don’t know the half of it,” remarked Livie. \\n\\n“What do you mean?” asked Joey.\\n\\n“The greatest cloud you speak of is the great storm!” exclaimed Livie. \\n\\n“So what?” asked Joey. \\n\\n“Mom said if you soar high into the storm there is great turbulence around the freezing level and you could collide with balls of ice that are tossing and churning up and down inside the cloud!” answered Livie. \\n\\n“That’s so cool!” exclaimed Joey. \\n\\n“It’s not funny,” replied Livie. “You must also watch out for strong shear currents created be-tween the downdraft and the thermal air flowing upward into the cloud. I’ve heard that the shearing winds between those up drafts and down drafts have torn birds apart!”\\n\\n“I still want to soar higher!” exclaimed Joey. “I want to soar to the top of the sky!” \\n\\n“I have heard that those up drafts and down drafts aren't even clearly defined as we just experi-enced for ourselves, Joey.

I have often eaten those berries with my friends. The mystical berries make me feel happy and strong. Then my friends and I soared, whirled around and around and talon locked all afternoon having great fun!” exclaimed Joey.\\n\\n“Will you go with me to eat the mystical berries now?” asked Joey. \\n\\nLivie did not answer.

The torque output of an engine depends on the force applied to the pistons, which is determined by the combustion of fuel in the engine's cylinders. The torque curve of an engine shows how the torque output changes with respect to engine speed.\\n\\nThere are several reasons why the torque curve of an engine is not linear. One reason is that the amount of fuel that can be burned in the engine's cylinders is limited by the size of the cylinders and the rate at which the fuel can be supplied to the cylinders. As the engine speed increases, the cylinders are required to complete more cycles per unit time, and the fuel supply may not be able to keep up with the increased demand. This can result in a decrease in torque output as the engine speed increases.\\n\\nAnother reason for the non-linearity of the torque curve is that the efficiency of the engine decreases at higher speeds due to factors such as frictional losses and heat dissipation. As the engine speed increases, these losses become more significant, resulting in a decrease in torque output.\\n\\nFinally, the torque curve may also be affected by the design of the engine and its components, such as the camshaft and valves, which can affect the amount of fuel that can be burned in the cylinders and the efficiency of the engine at different speeds.\\n\\nIn summary, the torque curve of an engine is not linear because it is influenced by the limitations on fuel supply, efficiency losses, and the design of the engine and its components.\"},\n",

Maybe days, maybe hours. At some point, the sounds became less strange, and the vision started to make sense. And finally, I tried to open my eyes, and tried to look, but my eyelids were stuck shut. I tried to say something, but only strangled moans came out. I did not know where I was, but knew that I was laying on a low bed of some kind, and I was naked except for the coverlet covering my body.\\nAnd finally, I felt something wet on my face: something was rubbing at my eyes. A gentle touch. It didn\\'t hurt, and when I lifted my head, the blurry world began to resolve itself into focus.\\nThere was a small figure before me - no taller than three feet - with large yellow eyes and pebbled green skin, and a broad, straight slash for a mouth. It wore a hooded garment that looked like some kind of rough fabric, almost like burlap, and an apron with pockets over that. And there was something hanging from its thick woven belt. I couldn\\'t tell what it was.\\nThe small being approached me, slowly. Its fingers gently rubbed my face, trying to remove the mucus from my eyes. It opened its froglike mouth for a moment, uttering a single line of chirps and clicks, varying in frequency. Then it stopped, was silent for a moment, and then tried again.\\n \\nI shook my head, weakly.\\n“No,\" I said, weakly, barely able to strangle it out. Other words came to my mind, sounding very different... ah! Another language. I repeated myself in that one, then in what little I knew of another. That flowed a little easier, but the little being seemed at just as much of a loss as it had when I had been speaking Co-... Co-Standard!\\nI saw the words \"Co-Standard\" in my mind, along with long strings of words and numbers that I still could not manage to get my head around. My native language was called Co-Standard, I realized. Was that it?\\n\"Do... you... Co-...\" I managed, struggling with getting my mouth to form the word-shapes. My throat seized and knotted painfully. \\nThe little being made a series of gestures with its hands, and I tried to copy. That, I could manage, somehow, though it kept shaking its head, and I realized that I wasn\\'t mirroring the expression properly.\\nIt seemed to understand that well enough, and it repeated the gestures: first, holding up a fist. I shook my head. It pushed its fist into the air, and then, brought its fist down onto its palm. Again. This time, I raised my right arm and made the same gesture. Then my left. I made sure to hold my arms above my head as far as possible, stretching them wide, as if giving myself the widest berth I could muster. The effort made my weak muscles tremble.\\nFinally, the little creature sighed in what I could only assume was either exasperation or relief. The glow from the candle near the wall faded slightly, but did not disappear entirely. \\nI lowered my arms, but remained still. That small amount of movement left me exhausted. The small thing came closer to me, touching my face, again and again. And then it repeated that gesture again.\\nI tried to sit up, but couldn\\'t; the effort left me breathless. And so I lay flat on my back, waiting. Why was I so weak?\\n \\nI dozed off, with the little creature still moving about the room, and looking over me here and there. After what seemed like hours, I felt a light pressure on my shoulder, and I heard the little frog-creature say something I couldn\\'t understand. \\nWhen I was certain that I could see without discomfort, I lifted my head just enough to allow my gaze to follow the small figure standing in front of me. It didn\\'t seem surprised, but simply moved on to another task, shuffling about the room - unless that was how it showed surprise. I blinked a few times. Then, when it returned to my face, I struggled to speak again, my words strangling in my throat.\\nThe small being\\'s smile - if its open-mouthed gape could be called that - broadened, and the color of its skin turned slightly paler. The little creature ambled over to my bedside again, with its rolling gait, and reached out and gently ran a finger along my cheekbone, before caressing the corner of my mouth. \"Rrrrrrr?\" it chirped, and it waved its hands and flicked its fingers around as it did so.\\nAnd finally, I managed: \"Where... am... I,\" struggling to get my lips and tongue around those words, and finally forcing them out.\\nMy brain must\\'ve had something left after all. It felt weird to be alive, to have words coming out of my mouth. That didn\\'t feel right. It should be something else. Like I\\'d spent so long screaming and choking on the nothingness inside me that my throat was still sore from doing it all the time. So the voice came out like an angry gargle, like someone screaming from a great distance, without much power behind it.\\nAnd finally, I looked over in the corner, noticing for the first time the items there, sitting on top of some kind of stool: an irreparably damaged space suit (how did I know that) and a space helmet. And on top of the folded suit, lay some items I recognized. A small box... no, it was a radio. Some kind of tool. And a slide rule. I felt some kind of certainty that these were my things, and it was the first time since waking up in this hut that I\\'d felt any kind of certainty about anything at all. But I couldn\\'t actually get over to the corner to look at those things, I couldn\\'t even get out of bed, I could barely turn over or lift my head. There was some kind of dull throbbing pain going through my entire body, from the soles of my feet to the tips of my fingers. \\nAs I sat there looking at those items in the corner, trying to find some sense of self-awareness in this dark world, it started to sink in:\\nThe truth hit me like a gut punch. If I could\\'ve put together some kind of decent explanation of how it happened, maybe I would\\'ve accepted it more easily. Pictures flashed in my brain of a variety of spacecraft experiencing any variety of explosions, catastrophes, crashes through the atmosphere. It seemed like a given that something of the kind had happened to me. If only I could remember. How long had I been here? A week? Two weeks? How had I ended up here? Did it even make any difference? \\nNo matter what the answers were, I knew they wouldn\\'t help me now. I didn\\'t know where I was supposed to be, only that it wasn\\'t here, and I had no choice but to stay for the moment. \\nWhat did I need to do next? Who could I ask for help, or was this the help? How was I going to get home?\\nI wasn\\'t really capable of getting up yet. I didn\\'t know how long that would take. I would have to work on it, and I forced myself to sit up on the low bed, before collapsing back down onto the bed again, breathless. I would have to try a little more each day, as long as my hosts were willing to keep me alive. At least until I was strong enough to leave. \\nI began to drift off again, imagining an answer to the question: How? How can I get out of here? What am I going to do? The possibilities swirled through my mind. It seemed obvious. Once I was well enough to get out of bed, I was going to have to get up and get a look at my surroundings.\\n. \\nDay after day, the somewhat frog-headed people took care of me. I could not discern gender among them or perhaps only one gender was allowed to handle me, so I had not seen the others. And perhaps their gender was something not easily transparent to me. \\nAbout ten of them had entered this room, taking turns with each other regarding my care. One of them was someone I took for some kind of medicine-person or doctor type or other person they considered learned, and that one had multiple garlands of strung beads (that looked like different colors of glass) around its neck, with some kind of tight-fitting hood over its head. This healer came in regularly, at every juncture checked on what I assumed its underlings and various visitors, and came to check on my wounds.\\nAt one point, two of the healer\\'s apprentices (I assumed, based on their identical dress to the healer) seemed to break out in an argument. \\nI watched and watched and tried to make note inside my mind about the level of light in the room - and I realized that for all I knew, I was underground. There was no way to tell the time by the light coming in from outside. But there was a certain regularity to my carers’ movements: they came in a specific order, first the short one, then the fat one (well, fatter than any of these beings, who all seemed on the slim side), then the healer with its staff and its apprentice bearing the tray of bowls and powders.\\nI could do nothing but tremble when one of them just barely touched me, as it felt as if its three spindly fingers had sunk into my flesh. The feeling remained after they left, and I was still too weak to move or resist.\\nThey varied as individuals, primarily in height (some were taller than others), build (some were stocky and some were thin though none of them could be called fat), and facial markings - some had yellow markings around their eyes and lips, some had a voluminous mass of reddish wrinkles below their throat and others did not. They all had the same uniformly pebbled green skin. They all had the same large saucerlike yellow eyes. \\nThey all communicated among themselves with a trilling, chirping language I couldn\\'t even begin to replicate with my throat; sometimes I found my throat making the noise on its own, after them, but I had no idea what I was saying, and they learned to ignore me when I tried to speak their language, and so I figured I would try to remain quiet until I had more sense of my bearings. \\nAnd when they attempted to communicate with me, it was either in that trill language or it was by that same gestural format that I recognized as a sign language. I probably had more of a chance of learning that. But somehow I knew that I needed to take my time with that as well. \\nI didn\\'t know the customs here. Anything could go wrong. I could continue to speak nonsense (or insults) and they could continue to ignore me, and or... I could keep my mouth shut until I actually had something meaningful to say. I felt amused in the moment because even on some unknown planet, it felt familiar, possibly one of the first things I’d ever learned.\\nAnd by then, I\\'d speak enough for them to actually want to help me learn more. Or they could choose to discard of me or... I knew there were lots of ways this could go, none of them good. \\nSo I let them babble and gesture while I thought things through. I figured I just about had no better of a chance of getting my bearings with these total strangers than I did with people like me, wherever I was from, with my two legs, bilateral symmetry, bipedalism, five fingers on each hand, five toes on each foot. Different from my hosts: with three long fingers on each green matchstick arm.\\nI studied the layout of the room again, noting that they had kept my things where I had found them.\\nThe only thing I could figure about them was that they must excrete the same way given my aides\\' familiarity with the basic mechanics of a bedpan. \\nThey acted with some confusion presented with another fact about my anatomy, and the discovery that I was bleeding between my legs led their medicine-person or doctor to come to inspect: I took that to assume they\\'d never met anything that bled for four days and didn\\'t die. I made mental note of that in case it was relevant about their species, but then I realized something just as important.\\nSomehow, I knew, and I didn\\'t know how I knew, but it seemed to follow from my starting my monthly while too weak to move, laying on an alien bed:\\n \\nI must\\'ve been unconscious for about a week and a half, making total time laid up here, almost two weeks.\\nAll I could do was to learn their routine, get very familiar with it, and steel myself for whatever each was going to attempt upon my person, and try to learn what I could however I could, about each one, and about where I was. \\nOn finding that I was a tiny bit stronger now - I could increasingly use the ceramic bedpan without too much additional help - I knew I had to get my strength back, so I tried to move about a bit, even as still confined to the bed: stretching my toes and fingers, lifting my arms and legs, twisting about and letting the blood flow, as if it might flow straight into my muscles and make them stronger. The efforts helped me regain a little bit of energy, and so I would lay back down again and doze off again, my muscles cramping. Little by little, I would get as much of my strength back as I could.\\nAt the moment, though, I could look around, look in each corner, and I saw that this small room had one doorway which led out into some kind of a hall, and that the walls seemed to be made of some kind of mud, and the floor of packed dirt, but covered with colorful tapestries. There were small candles - no, oil lamps of some kind - on a low flat rock in the corner, and I smelled something that smelled like... rancid tallow came to mind, but then I realized I didn\\'t even know what that smelled like. And it gave the whole place a certain dimly lighted atmosphere and made the shadows appear so much longer. \\nAnd... I felt a sinking feeling in my gut, because looking at the adobe walls, and the packed dirt floor, and the woven tapestries and oil lamps, and my suit and helmet and gloves sitting on a stool in the corner, I knew one thing.\\nWherever I was, I might just have to get used to being here. Because looking around, I knew that the chances I was leaving, were probably slim to none.\\n \\nWherever I was. Wherever I was from. Whoever I was.\\nEach day passed very like the last. I could now sit up in bed on my own for large parts of the day, and move about a little bit on my wobbly legs. Though the effort temporarily exhausted me, each day I grew a little stronger than the day before. I kept working on it: moving my arms and legs, taxing my core muscles. Eventually I managed to get onto my knees and push myself forward to standing, supported by the side of the bed. Gradually, over a few days, I built up to sitting in a chair for longer periods. When I began to stand on my own I realized how badly my muscles had wasted away, especially my quadriceps, but it felt so good to feel those old leg muscles twitch under my weight. Between visits by my froglike caregivers, in particular the healer\\'s rounds (which could be timed absolutely to level of light in the room, and I also knew that once the healer had visited, it would not be back for a while), I was left to myself.\\nI finally made it over to the stool in the corner, where the spacesuit, helmet, gloves, and the various items - the small radio, the slide rule, and what looked to be a handheld tool - sat, and sitting there before these items, I looked them over.\\nLooking at the helmet and suit brought to mind countless images of other helmets and suits, various makes and types: and my hands twitched looking at the gloves. The helmet had the word \"RENBERG\" stamped on it and my mouth formed the letters, and my heartbeat quickened when I realized what I was looking at. And a glint off the faceplate struck me… and there was a woman staring back at me, and I felt a familiar discomfort in my gut on meeting her dark green eyes. Short gold hair, shorter on the sides: it sat limply on my scalp, having not been washed. Earrings - no, they weren’t earrings, they were polished black plugs, about the circumference of my thumb. My face was stern and plain and rawboned, with high sharp cheekbones, a straight slash of a mouth with no smile lines, and most curious of all - the thin line tattoos that ran down the right side of my face and neck, and then on my chin, tattoos that reminded me of feline markings. I felt… I should feel something about these, but nothing came to me, it was as locked behind a wall of gray fuzz inside my brain as the rest of my memories.\\nMy fingers reached up, shaking, and traced two vertical dark blue lines down the right side of my face, then down my neck, where they formed a simple geometric pattern that ended at my collarbone. This was recent, and still healing. And then there were the thin vertical lines on my chin (four to be precise: two straight short lines, between two longer curved ones), somewhat faded. Those had been there a while.\\nMy heart raced, and I took a deep breath, willing steadiness into myself again. I forced myself to look away from my reflection. \\nI looked down at my arms: and for the first time, it clicked. The bands of ink around my wrists, various glyphs and markings on my arms. I knew somehow that every single mark on my body had some kind of meaning. It all seemed significant somehow, but nothing clicked. \\nI found myself thinking about my breathing: about the time spent doing nothing but breathing before putting on the suit, then, inside the portable potential tomb of a spacesuit, set against hard vacuum, the shallow breaths intended to conserve oxygen.\\nMy mind flashed to the magnetized boots, holding their wearer still while standing on a relay. These memories rushed in upon me like an avalanche of darkening clouds. Whenever walking along the relay, the faint glow of the battery cell within the helmet itself did little to lift the sense of fear, isolation, cold and dark I experienced, when alone, inside the helmet, within the suit.\\nAnd the deep fatigue I experienced was amplified, deepened by the memory of solitude and loneliness. And yet it was comforting. Somehow, inside myself, I knew it to be more comforting sometimes to be outside, just me and the unbending laws of physics and hard vacuum, surrounded by the curtain of stars, than to be inside, among the others. Where nothing else mattered but the task at hand, in the unforgiving nothing of space. \\nPerhaps I am saying something trite and meaningless. Perhaps it is not for me to say whether such an experience was meaningless or not. It was what it was.\\nI ran my hand along the suit\\'s neck ring, and then, rested it on the helmet. I reached to try to lift with both hands. My arms shook. At once I understood the cause of my weakness, my wasted muscles.\\nIt was obvious to me. Before I woke up here, I had been in space. Long enough to lose my strength. Without the drugs to help the body withstand lower G over time - wait, that was a thing! On a ship without a centrifugal force based gravity ring - oh! There was another thing I knew about! It somehow seemed wrong that I should find myself here. \\nI sat with the memories right on the tip of my mind, the way that a word can be said to be on the tip of your tongue, filing through pictures and wondering which were my memories, still uncertain of what was what.\\nI picked up the items: the gloves. Something came to my mind: a painful tenderness in my fingertips, a ghost sensation I could feel in the moment, and pulling a glove off of my hand to find my fingertips raw and bloody, and feeling nothing on it - just the processing of images in my mind of it happening again, again, again. I felt excited, knowing this to be memory. The radio, the slide rule, the tool: I hefted each of these, one and then another, and they had one thing in common. On each of them was a plastic label with embossed, raised writing: \"VAL S. RENBERG.\"\\nThe tool had a button, and a metal latch that seemed like it would be some kind of a safety. I understood somehow not to pick it up, unlatch it, and point it at anything. Not in here. It would have to wait.\\n \\nThere was a final item here, that somehow I had missed in my accounting: a silvery metal ball-chain necklace, with a quarter-inch by quarter-inch... orange metal thing attached to it. It looked like this was some kind of a little container, bisected by a thin seam. I worked my thumbnail into the seam - and the top half of the container detached from the bottom half with a “pop” and slid off, revealing a thin chip of metal inside. It didn\\'t trigger any memories. Obviously it was important or I would not have taken it into space. It would be important to hold onto. I picked it up, and with my arm shaking, slipped it back around my neck.\\nI heard footsteps in the hall, and quickly, made it back to the bed, and back under the covers. I was exhausted by this effort, anyway. \\nAt least I knew who I was: if these were indeed my things, then chances were high that I was in fact called Val S. Renberg. There were a lot of potential reasons it might not be so, but the possibility that this was actually me, seemed as likely as any of them. \\nIt wasn\\'t long before the last ounce of energy left me, and I simply gave in to it. My body shut down. I let it all go. A profound sleep came over me, as if my subconscious could tell I had run out of things to think about.\\n\\n \\\\*\\\\*\\nThe dreams were the strangest things. Sometimes I was in a room, with a flickering, buzzing bright light above me. In every dream, it was the same hard chair. I sat in my chair backwards, leaning the front of my body against the back of the chair, my arms crossed in front of me across the top of the chair’s backrest. The questioner - always a human, always the same younger fair-skinned man with ginger hair - told me he wouldn\\'t talk to me until I sat normally. I rearranged myself in the chair, and finally I was there, trying to find a comfortable position, crossing my legs one direction, then the other.\\n\"Are you ready to give your deposition now, Syndic Renberg?\" the questioner asked.\\n\"What?\" I asked. \"You want to ask me questions?\"\\n\"No, this is a deposition,\" he spoke slowly, emphasizing each word. \"That means I am taking your testimony under oath.\"\\nIf only I were able to read anything in my dreams, to make out the name on his shiny metal nametag, obscured as it was by shadows and the strange reflections from the flickers of the buzzing light overhead. If only I could recognize the faces of those other people who appeared from time to time. But the images would flicker, the questions would stop, and the dreams would end. Or they would become new, different dreams. And then, I\\'d start to tell my side of the story again, and the dream would be over. Each time. At no point in my dream did I ever know what I was being questioned about. In some dreams the room was empty and in some it had some built-in filing cabinets and old posters on the wall portraying the various worlds. There were several other humans present in these dreams, sitting behind the desk or typing away on computers, nodding occasionally at my answers. They always seemed bored, like they really weren\\'t interested in hearing my side of the story.\\n\\nIt was one more of a scattershot, a 52-pick-up of random events recurring in my dreams, sometimes in my tired mind as a reverie, too consistent to not be memories. But unconnected to anything, let alone to each other. As it happened, the last of those dreams had occurred during my captivity, the first after my small froglike hosts had witnessed my return to consciousness. As usual, I awoke drenched in sweat, unable to move. Always there was a sense of dread, of a hollow aching emptiness that stalked me well into the day.\\nBut these were not the only dreams I had.\\nSometimes I was on some strange world full of domed farming settlements. In some parts of the settlement, where the real work went on, knee-high robots skittered about, sometimes telescoping their bodies to reach the higher branches of the trees they picked. And then after walking down a lone narrow path, I was in a room full of humans, all of them not wearing a single stitch of clothing, and most with colorful swirls and flowers painted on their bodies - paint, not tattoo. They laughed among themselves, and sipped their drinks from their handmade ceramic cups, and freely mingled in this room full of exotic plants and colored lights, and some reclined on large cushions on the floor, in groups ranging from two to four. No doubt the heat and humidity in what amounted to a giant domed greenhouse must have driven them to strip down, to allow themselves a chance to cool off. For some reason, in these dreams, I was always looking at their arms and backs for tattoos, and anxious that I didn\\'t see any, for I could deign no sign of what any of these people did, of their individuality, of their loyalties, their work. Always in this dream I felt the walls closing in on me, I felt like I couldn\\'t breathe, and I was trying to get out in a panic but am having to bump against sweaty naked flesh with every inch of progress I make toward the single door. And in the dream I was lost between not wanting any part of their sex party while being insulted that I wasn\\'t invited, and preparing multiple answers in my head about what I\\'m going to reply if they did actually invite me.\\nIn other dreams, I found myself a small child wandering through the dark tunnels beneath my city - but on waking I could never place where that was. It was all twisted corridors, staircases leading nowhere, rooms full of the eerie noises of pipes, steam vents, machinery.In these dreams, I was carrying a thick book full of equations and schematics and blueprints, hurrying down a dark corridor while the city\\'s colorfully lit spires towered above, but I kept my eyes down, avoiding the city\\'s various denizens as I made it to school in the dark. Sometimes I would look up and there would be a huge sign shining down: three proud space travelers with helmets, and what looked to be a symbol I couldn\\'t quite make out, and the thick block letters spelling \"WE’VE GOT THIS.\" This I understood immediately and it was the only thing in any one of my dreams that I could ever read.\\nBut always there was one dream, recurring, that was comforting. In this dream I was standing on a catwalk, on what I recognized to be a shipyard in space. The rumbling of the ships leaving dock, always at the same time, always with the same procedure as they launched. In some of these dreams I was young, an older child standing on these walkways. In some I was an adult wearing a flight suit, standing before a panel of switches and dials. In these dreams I always knew where I was: and in this last one, I was at the shipyard near the barren rock called Point Destruction. I knew what I was supposed to do, and replied during headcount, and I knew what part I played in the fifty-person crew that kept a Massive Container Transport flying intersystem.\\nBut more, in some of these dreams of working in space, there was a large, tall man - or perhaps it\\'s more fair to say that he was a male. Tall pointed, tufted ears and a whiskered muzzle like a lynx\\'s, a long braided mane meticulously tied back in a topknot. Intelligent golden eyes.\\nIn my dreams the sleeves of his flight suit are pushed back to reveal the artfully swirling dark blue tattoos visible through the brown short-trimmed fur on his muscular arms, and his long tail wrapped around a hand-hold to secure himself in microgravity, leaving his hands free. Sometimes I was sitting beside him in a small two-seater in space, listening to him sing in another language... not my native language and nonetheless I understood the words, and sometimes I sang with him.\\nAnd when I woke up from this dream, always, I\\'d try to connect it to something, try to remember something, and... that\\'s that. My memories felt like they were on the tip of my mind the way that a word is said to be on the tip of your tongue.\\nI didn\\'t know what I was remembering, but I knew what emotion I felt when I was awake, and it was a profound sense of homesickness, of belonging somewhere. It was when I had these dreams in particular that I would wake with my chest aching with an emotion I couldn’t find a word for, an empty pit inside I couldn’t name, and couldn’t fill.\\nAnd always on waking, I’d look over at the space suit and helmet and other things in the corner. The suit was damaged beyond usability; it only took a single examination and a double-check to feel safe concluding that my small froglike hosts had cut me out of it. \\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\nMy recovery felt painfully slow. Each day I pushed myself further than the day before. Each day they fed me the same bitter hot drink and the same thick milky gruel five times a day, insisting I take it, and though I tried hard not to gag on it because it had roughly the same consistency and taste as phlegm, I made myself swallow it because for all I knew, no other food was coming. Besides, I was getting stronger. And I was alive. That alone gave me hope.\\nMy legs no longer shook after standing on them for five minutes, and each day I\\'d been able to stand, and walk around, just a bit more. Now - roughly four days into my regaining consciousness in this small room - I was going to find out where I was.\\nOver the next few hours, I watched each of my hosts come and go from the room: first the short one, then the fat one, then the tall healer and their assistant. Following the healer\\'s departure, I would be left alone for some hours, and if it were like any other day, then the hall would be clear for a while.\\nI silently counted in my mind, backward from 200, after I\\'d heard the last of the healer\\'s and apprentice\\'s footfalls fade from view, and then I sat up, grabbing the coverlet from the bed and tying it around my body so that it covered my torso, hanging free down to my knees.\\nAnd then I stood, stepping from one foot to the other, on the balls of my feet, as lightly as I could manage, and quietly, I grabbed one of the oil-lamps from the floor and I stepped from the room, and assessed my environment. The ceiling being barely a few inches above my head, I ducked my head when I stepped out the door.\\nThe walls here were some type of stone, bare of paint or decorations. There were a few other open, arch-shaped doorways like the one I\\'d come through, but I saw no sign of windows. Was I underground? Most of the rooms were empty, though I heard - a few doors down - the faint chittering and trilling of frog-people talking to each other. It was a comfortable temperature here, just slightly warm. I thought it best to go in the opposite direction of the chittering frog-people down the hall, and as I crept down the hall, I spotted another open doorway immediately to the right of the doorway from which I\\'d emerged, and what looked to be some kind of cabinet or store room - I stepped just inside the door, holding my oil lamp in any direction I wanted to look in.\\nThe place was very clean and tidy, the shelves well-organized, stacked neatly in rows and columns. Handmade ceramic bowls of what looked to be various electronic parts and widgets - wires, bolts, nuts. The shelf beneath held rows of smaller objects, both familiar in form and not: pieces of machinery and gears and wheels that seemed to be the common shape of so many bipedal, bilateral symmetry species\\' pre-spacefaring industrial technology. But it was what lay behind the rows of neatly stacked objects and arranged ceramic bowls that caught my attention. Pieces of milky crystal, ranging in size from my thumb to the size of my arm. I set my oil-lamp down onto the shelf, and I picked up one of the smaller crystals and held it up to the light, turning it over to look at every aspect of it; it wasn\\'t raw rock crystal but instead somehow machine-tooled. Finally there was a larger bowl sitting on this shelf, and there was an assortment in it that was hearteningly familiar: objects that looked carved from crystal themselves, some from something that resembled obsidian, but were unmistakably tools. Tools of various shapes and sizes, crude implements and even ornate devices made by someone who had seen their work, who cared about making beautiful and functional tools. All these objects looked centuries old. My eyes drifted over the surface of a small object I held in my hand: a fine pointed stone meant to cut things precisely but which, I thought in the moment, could probably be used to pry, or - should I encounter anything resembling a screw - in the place of a flathead screwdriver, though I already had one on my multitool. There was a pair of tarnished metal goggles here, too - the metal resembled brass - with dark lenses. The band was makeshift, made of two strips of braided cloth meant to be tied at the back of the head. Where could these have come from? Did these people grind glass, or...\\nI lifted the goggles to my face, and then tied the two straps behind my head, and looked around. The lenses cut the light by half, and were surprisingly lightweight. I lifted them back up to my forehead, and continued to look around. This place had tools! Some scrapers, pliers, knives. And on top of all that, some weird objects I didn\\'t recognize, although they reminded me of a sort of gardening tool, with two tines at the end. Finally, satisfied with what I saw, I turned around, to look at the shelves on the other side of me. But as I did, I startled suddenly as something trilled softly behind me.\\nI jumped backwards, stumbling, catching myself before I fell. It was one of the frog-people: the healer\\'s tall, thin apprentice.\\n\"Rrrr?\" it trilled again, and within moments, two other of the frog-people emerged behind it.\\n\"Shit,\" I said aloud, holding my hands up in front of me. \"Look, don\\'t worry about it.\"\\nI remembered the goggles on top of my head, and reached for them, putting them back on the shelf behind me, then turning, holding my hands up. \"Sorry!\" I called out. \"Just curious is all.\"\\n\"Rrrr?\" one of the frog-people said, sounding hesitant.\\n\"Oh, I\\'m sorry!\" I exclaimed, \"You must think I\\'m really rude. You know, exploring places where you\\'re not supposed to...\"\\n\"Rrrr.\"\\n\"I\\'ll go back to my room.\"\\n\"Rrrr.\"\\n\"Well, thanks anyway,\" I said, nodding awkwardly, and I backed away from the shelf, holding my hands up. They moved aside to let me pass, then disappeared into the shadows beyond. I breathed a sigh of relief, then looked down the hall I\\'d just come from, toward the sounds of chatter from the other end. But I thought the better of it, and headed back toward my room. And there, in the middle of the room, the healer stood, holding its staff. I stood still, and the healer looked over me, up and down, and finally, it brought its three-fingered hands to its eyes, and made the shape of goggles. \"Rrr?\"\\nI put my hands up to my face, copying the gesture. \"Rrr.\"\\nIt held up a hand, then brought its other hand over, making a gesture as if to hold one of the small tools I\\'d just examined in the storeroom, and it turned the hand as if turning the tool. \"Rr?\"\\nI repeated the gesture, imagining the tool in my hand. I had no idea what I was telling them. Just that it seemed natural.\\nAnd finally, the healer stood, and said nothing for a long time, but turned toward its assistant and two other frog-people, who stood in the doorway, and chirped at them, and they cleared out of the way as two other frog-people emerged. They were dragging something. I watched, intrigued. The large object made a dragging sound against the floor. It looked like some kind of clumsily assembled mannequin, or...\\nI looked closer. It lacked a head, and loose connectors and stiff wires stuck out from its neck, and what\\'s more, was that it appeared to be assembled of mismatched bits, a clear plastic panel here, a metal panel there...\\nIt was a robot.\\nAnd I sat with this for a moment, while the healer looked at me, then repeated the “tool using” gesture with its hands that I had copied just a moment before.\\nI considered all of the information available to me - the various bits and bobs of technology in the storeroom that somehow didn’t fit with the Neolithic conditions in which I was being kept, that didn’t seem to fit any one coherent pattern or aesthetic to indicate a single technological base, and now, there was a broken robot hauled in front of me.\\nI glanced over at the spacesuit in the corner, and considered the slide rule (probably a foreign object to them) and the multitool (similar enough to other tools that were in that storeroom) that had been there among my things, and that these people had - I presumed - pulled me from a wrecked vessel. And now - I was sure - I was being kept in an underground facility.\\nI felt safe in assuming the frog-people to be scavenging technology, and possibly hiding it.\\nMy gut clenched in dread. I had to get to the outside. I had to know where I was. I had to know where I had come from.\\nI looked back at the headless robot. “I’m just going to have to try,” I said to no one in particular. \\nIt rolled off of my tongue as if I’d said this many, many times before, and the clench in my gut told me that enough of those times, I’d tried and failed, and that the failures mattered gravely. \\n\\nWANDERER CHAPTER 3\\nALEX WEINBERG \\nAs soon as they were gone, I turned away from the robot and hurried over to the wall of shelves along the back wall. Several things caught my eye, but not a single thing was anything I recognized. At least the actual raw materials were familiar: random bits of copper and crystal, various rings and washers of some kind of rubberlike material. Not here, nor in the storeroom, had I run into anything resemble the circuit testers I saw pictures of in my mind, as if the memory were there, waiting. This didn\\'t mean they weren\\'t available somewhere, I reminded myself. It only meant that I hadn\\'t found them yet. Or that they didn\\'t look anything like what we had back home… wherever “home” happened to be. I wondered what they looked like, then shook my head to clear it. It didn\\'t matter; what mattered was getting this working again.\\n\"I need a manual,\" I muttered, shaking my head. \"Well. Better know what I\\'m getting myself into.\"\\n\\nI had no way to judge the time, but estimated that I sat for a few hours, just staring at the robot, even as my bladder ached. I\\'d examined the thing up and down, looking for some kind of seam, trying to deign some kind of clue as to this contraption\\'s assemblage. Some of it seemed... random. Its arms didn\\'t seem to match - the left had a clear plastic-looking casing wherein you could see the wires and servos inside, and the right was articulated chrome. And in the middle of its chest sat a plate with what I can only presume was a socket into which could be attached a third arm. It didn\\'t look like it went with the rest of the robot. Who was the original maker of this thing? Was it getting salvaged again, again, added onto again and again? What even powered this thing? Why? There was no obvious power source or plug of any kind. No wires coming out anywhere, nothing plugged into the front, none of the obvious stuff. These were all questions I asked myself over and over again, trying to put together the puzzle. Could I reach up, unscrew anything? Was there anything that came apart from anything else? And if I did, what might happen if I opened something that wasn\\'t supposed to be opened? I felt nervous enough already, thinking about how easily this could break, given the wrong circumstances.\\n\"Shit,\" I muttered to myself.\\nI don\\'t know how long I sat there, just staring at the robot. I know that two helpings of the frog-people\\'s nutri-slime had been placed next to me, spaced some time apart, and that they\\'d also brought me drinking bowls of hot water. I did manage to get up to relieve myself twice. And then returned to the robot, looking it up and down, detaching this or that limb as I could, and feeling anywhere I could for some kind of a seam.\\n\\nAnd there it was... something that resembled a plate with a seam. I reached under one side of the plate, digging my short fingernails into the seam, and... there. The plate popped off, landing on the floor at my feet. And under it, was a tangle of wires, obscuring a... row of familiar looking switches. Well, whoever built this thing, clearly thought and built in binary... and thought to build a robot with humanoid arms, humanoid legs. Except binary wasn\\'t even necessarily the norm among all humanoids. I sighed in frustration and exhaustion because the insides were as much of a mismatched hodge-podge as the outsides, and whoev er worked on this thing before, had terrible cable management. A little of this wire here, a bit of that wire there, half buried, almost covered by another wire... like an art project gone awry. This place looked like someone threw everything in the house that would fit in here and set it to a robotic assembler to work on it, until the person finally came back to pick it up. Who knows. I bent down, poking around through the wires, poking and prodding and pushing. After some effort, I found one end of the main wire running out of the torso section of the machine. And with some searching, I located another piece of loose wire going to the base.\\nI traced it back to where it would be connected, and... no. The wrong kind of connector. Whatever the other end was supposed to be doing, this was not it. I rubbed my eyes. I was ready to cry from frustration when I walked back to my room, and as soon as I sat down on the mat that passed for a bed, I felt the heaviest weariness sink into my bones, making my body feel heavy. I don\\'t remember leaning back onto the bed and falling asleep, that\\'s how exhausted I was. \\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nMy dreams that night were as strange as any the nights before. In those dreams, I\\'m with him again, on that little yellow ship. The large feline man who sings in his language every time he pulls the little yellow two-seater out of its berth. First he takes a small bag - some kind of leather, from the looks of it - from the inside of his shirt, and affixes it to the instrument panel. Then he unwinds the bracelet he always wears - a length of braid, like braided hair - and wraps that around the throttle. Pilots and navigators, always such a superstitious lot. But it\\'s what he always does next that fascinates me: each step in his song, goes to a specific pre-flight check. I have to listen closely to follow along. By the time we are in the cockpit again, we\\'re both suited up, and we\\'re underway. The cockpit is silent save for the low humming of the engines, and his soft humming over his helmet\\'s speaker. It\\'s such a simple song, and yet each time, it carries us forward with the utmost precision. Somehow this time I am singing with him. And then it comes into view, Ansible Relay 44\\'s miles of panels. This time, I know the song. I know what every step in this process is, and it\\'s come to give me comfort, too, in its never-changingness. For as far as I can remember, he has sung these steps with the same accuracy. It doesn\\'t matter whether I know them, or whether he chooses to explain them. The meaning behind them remains constant. So it will go. Always forward. I will step out of this little ship, my magnetized boots holding me fast to the relay. And when I return to the little yellow ship, I\\'ll find that my feline companion - his name is Kesh, I think - has been singing this whole time, singing me back. And I will ask him about it. And he will glance away from me, chuckle slightly, and say \"I would only not sing you back if I meant to leave you out on that relay.\"\\nAnd somehow, that means something to me, because somehow I know that there haven\\'t been that many people I would trust not to. But I trust him.\\nAnd then seemingly all at once, I\\'m in a small compartment with him, the kind you can get for shared quarters on a Massive Container Transport - somehow in my dreams, I know this. I am laying on the rack beside him, curled against him, my head resting in the crook of his shoulder. He takes my hand, twining my fingers in his, then finally, raising it up to his furry cheek, pressing my hand down the grain of his feline whiskers. There is a deep rumbling in his broad furry chest, and my fingers trace the tabby stripes of his shoulders and face. We stay like that for some time, my head against his fur, the feeling of it beneath my chin warm and comforting. At last, he releases my hand, turning it so that I can lay it on his heart. And it\\'s there I know the feeling for what it is: love. He reaches over, touching the faint lines tattooed on my chin, that resemble his own. My fingers find the braid of hair wound in a bracelet around his wrist - my golden hair braided with the hairs of his darker, courser mane. It has the feel of fine cord. \"R\\'Kesh,\" I whisper, and he turns to me.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s just then that the dream ended, and I was awake.\\nR\\'Kesh. The name repeated too often to not be his name. He was the first person I remembered since awakening here, and the feeling in my chest told me who he was. My mate, and he was out there… somewhere. And I was here. Wherever “here” was.\\n Wanderer\\nAlex Weinberg\\n \\nChapter 1\\n \\nI don\\'t know what was a dream or a hallucination. From time to time, I felt something damp on my body, and saw a light behind my closed eyes, and heard sounds that I couldn\\'t decipher. Sometimes, someone leaned over me and poured something into my mouth, holding the back of my head with their other hand. Sometimes it was something acrid and bitter. Sometimes it was a gluey substance that nearly made me choke and gag, and yet I was too weak to resist. Sometimes someone squeezed a wet cloth into my mouth. I don\\'t know how much time passed. Maybe days, maybe hours. At some point, the sounds became less strange, and the vision started to make sense. And finally, I tried to open my eyes, and tried to look, but my eyelids were stuck shut. I tried to say something, but only strangled moans came out. I did not know where I was, but knew that I was laying on a low bed of some kind, and I was naked except for the coverlet covering my body.\\nAnd finally, I felt something wet on my face: something was rubbing at my eyes. A gentle touch. It didn\\'t hurt, and when I lifted my head, the blurry world began to resolve itself into focus.\\nThere was a small figure before me - no taller than three feet - with large yellow eyes and pebbled green skin, and a broad, straight slash for a mouth. It wore a hooded garment that looked like some kind of rough fabric, almost like burlap, and an apron with pockets over that. And there was something hanging from its thick woven belt. I couldn\\'t tell what it was.\\nThe small being approached me, slowly. Its fingers gently rubbed my face, trying to remove the mucus from my eyes. It opened its froglike mouth for a moment, uttering a single line of chirps and clicks, varying in frequency. Then it stopped, was silent for a moment, and then tried again.\\n \\nI shook my head, weakly.\\n“No,\" I said, weakly, barely able to strangle it out. Other words came to my mind, sounding very different... ah! Another language. I repeated myself in that one, then in what little I knew of another. That flowed a little easier, but the little being seemed at just as much of a loss as it had when I had been speaking Co-... Co-Standard!\\nI saw the words \"Co-Standard\" in my mind, along with long strings of words and numbers that I still could not manage to get my head around. My native language was called Co-Standard, I realized. Was that it?\\n\"Do... you... Co-...\" I managed, struggling with getting my mouth to form the word-shapes. My throat seized and knotted painfully. \\nThe little being made a series of gestures with its hands, and I tried to copy. That, I could manage, somehow, though it kept shaking its head, and I realized that I wasn\\'t mirroring the expression properly.\\nIt seemed to understand that well enough, and it repeated the gestures: first, holding up a fist. I shook my head. It pushed its fist into the air, and then, brought its fist down onto its palm. Again. This time, I raised my right arm and made the same gesture. Then my left. I made sure to hold my arms above my head as far as possible, stretching them wide, as if giving myself the widest berth I could muster. The effort made my weak muscles tremble.\\nFinally, the little creature sighed in what I could only assume was either exasperation or relief. The glow from the candle near the wall faded slightly, but did not disappear entirely. \\nI lowered my arms, but remained still. That small amount of movement left me exhausted. The small thing came closer to me, touching my face, again and again. And then it repeated that gesture again.\\nI tried to sit up, but couldn\\'t; the effort left me breathless. And so I lay flat on my back, waiting. Why was I so weak?\\n \\nI dozed off, with the little creature still moving about the room, and looking over me here and there. After what seemed like hours, I felt a light pressure on my shoulder, and I heard the little frog-creature say something I couldn\\'t understand. \\nWhen I was certain that I could see without discomfort, I lifted my head just enough to allow my gaze to follow the small figure standing in front of me. It didn\\'t seem surprised, but simply moved on to another task, shuffling about the room - unless that was how it showed surprise. I blinked a few times. Then, when it returned to my face, I struggled to speak again, my words strangling in my throat.\\nThe small being\\'s smile - if its open-mouthed gape could be called that - broadened, and the color of its skin turned slightly paler. The little creature ambled over to my bedside again, with its rolling gait, and reached out and gently ran a finger along my cheekbone, before caressing the corner of my mouth. \"Rrrrrrr?\" it chirped, and it waved its hands and flicked its fingers around as it did so.\\nAnd finally, I managed: \"Where... am... I,\" struggling to get my lips and tongue around those words, and finally forcing them out.\\nMy brain must\\'ve had something left after all. It felt weird to be alive, to have words coming out of my mouth. That didn\\'t feel right. It should be something else. Like I\\'d spent so long screaming and choking on the nothingness inside me that my throat was still sore from doing it all the time. So the voice came out like an angry gargle, like someone screaming from a great distance, without much power behind it.\\nAnd finally, I looked over in the corner, noticing for the first time the items there, sitting on top of some kind of stool: an irreparably damaged space suit (how did I know that) and a space helmet. And on top of the folded suit, lay some items I recognized. A small box... no, it was a radio. Some kind of tool. And a slide rule. I felt some kind of certainty that these were my things, and it was the first time since waking up in this hut that I\\'d felt any kind of certainty about anything at all. But I couldn\\'t actually get over to the corner to look at those things, I couldn\\'t even get out of bed, I could barely turn over or lift my head. There was some kind of dull throbbing pain going through my entire body, from the soles of my feet to the tips of my fingers. \\nAs I sat there looking at those items in the corner, trying to find some sense of self-awareness in this dark world, it started to sink in:\\nThe truth hit me like a gut punch. If I could\\'ve put together some kind of decent explanation of how it happened, maybe I would\\'ve accepted it more easily. Pictures flashed in my brain of a variety of spacecraft experiencing any variety of explosions, catastrophes, crashes through the atmosphere. It seemed like a given that something of the kind had happened to me. If only I could remember. How long had I been here? A week? Two weeks? How had I ended up here? Did it even make any difference? \\nNo matter what the answers were, I knew they wouldn\\'t help me now. I didn\\'t know where I was supposed to be, only that it wasn\\'t here, and I had no choice but to stay for the moment. \\nWhat did I need to do next? Who could I ask for help, or was this the help? How was I going to get home?\\nI wasn\\'t really capable of getting up yet. I didn\\'t know how long that would take. I would have to work on it, and I forced myself to sit up on the low bed, before collapsing back down onto the bed again, breathless. I would have to try a little more each day, as long as my hosts were willing to keep me alive. At least until I was strong enough to leave. \\nI began to drift off again, imagining an answer to the question: How? How can I get out of here? What am I going to do? The possibilities swirled through my mind. It seemed obvious. Once I was well enough to get out of bed, I was going to have to get up and get a look at my surroundings.\\n. \\nDay after day, the somewhat frog-headed people took care of me. I could not discern gender among them or perhaps only one gender was allowed to handle me, so I had not seen the others. And perhaps their gender was something not easily transparent to me. \\nAbout ten of them had entered this room, taking turns with each other regarding my care. One of them was someone I took for some kind of medicine-person or doctor type or other person they considered learned, and that one had multiple garlands of strung beads (that looked like different colors of glass) around its neck, with some kind of tight-fitting hood over its head. This healer came in regularly, at every juncture checked on what I assumed its underlings and various visitors, and came to check on my wounds.\\nAt one point, two of the healer\\'s apprentices (I assumed, based on their identical dress to the healer) seemed to break out in an argument. \\nI watched and watched and tried to make note inside my mind about the level of light in the room - and I realized that for all I knew, I was underground. There was no way to tell the time by the light coming in from outside. But there was a certain regularity to my carers’ movements: they came in a specific order, first the short one, then the fat one (well, fatter than any of these beings, who all seemed on the slim side), then the healer with its staff and its apprentice bearing the tray of bowls and powders.\\nI could do nothing but tremble when one of them just barely touched me, as it felt as if its three spindly fingers had sunk into my flesh. The feeling remained after they left, and I was still too weak to move or resist.\\nThey varied as individuals, primarily in height (some were taller than others), build (some were stocky and some were thin though none of them could be called fat), and facial markings - some had yellow markings around their eyes and lips, some had a voluminous mass of reddish wrinkles below their throat and others did not. They all had the same uniformly pebbled green skin. They all had the same large saucerlike yellow eyes. \\nThey all communicated among themselves with a trilling, chirping language I couldn\\'t even begin to replicate with my throat; sometimes I found my throat making the noise on its own, after them, but I had no idea what I was saying, and they learned to ignore me when I tried to speak their language, and so I figured I would try to remain quiet until I had more sense of my bearings. \\nAnd when they attempted to communicate with me, it was either in that trill language or it was by that same gestural format that I recognized as a sign language. I probably had more of a chance of learning that. But somehow I knew that I needed to take my time with that as well. \\nI didn\\'t know the customs here. Anything could go wrong. I could continue to speak nonsense (or insults) and they could continue to ignore me, and or... I could keep my mouth shut until I actually had something meaningful to say. I felt amused in the moment because even on some unknown planet, it felt familiar, possibly one of the first things I’d ever learned.\\nAnd by then, I\\'d speak enough for them to actually want to help me learn more. Or they could choose to discard of me or... I knew there were lots of ways this could go, none of them good. \\nSo I let them babble and gesture while I thought things through. I figured I just about had no better of a chance of getting my bearings with these total strangers than I did with people like me, wherever I was from, with my two legs, bilateral symmetry, bipedalism, five fingers on each hand, five toes on each foot. Different from my hosts: with three long fingers on each green matchstick arm.\\nI studied the layout of the room again, noting that they had kept my things where I had found them.\\nThe only thing I could figure about them was that they must excrete the same way given my aides\\' familiarity with the basic mechanics of a bedpan. \\nThey acted with some confusion presented with another fact about my anatomy, and the discovery that I was bleeding between my legs led their medicine-person or doctor to come to inspect: I took that to assume they\\'d never met anything that bled for four days and didn\\'t die. I made mental note of that in case it was relevant about their species, but then I realized something just as important.\\nSomehow, I knew, and I didn\\'t know how I knew, but it seemed to follow from my starting my monthly while too weak to move, laying on an alien bed:\\n \\nI must\\'ve been unconscious for about a week and a half, making total time laid up here, almost two weeks.\\nAll I could do was to learn their routine, get very familiar with it, and steel myself for whatever each was going to attempt upon my person, and try to learn what I could however I could, about each one, and about where I was. \\nOn finding that I was a tiny bit stronger now - I could increasingly use the ceramic bedpan without too much additional help - I knew I had to get my strength back, so I tried to move about a bit, even as still confined to the bed: stretching my toes and fingers, lifting my arms and legs, twisting about and letting the blood flow, as if it might flow straight into my muscles and make them stronger. The efforts helped me regain a little bit of energy, and so I would lay back down again and doze off again, my muscles cramping. Little by little, I would get as much of my strength back as I could.\\nAt the moment, though, I could look around, look in each corner, and I saw that this small room had one doorway which led out into some kind of a hall, and that the walls seemed to be made of some kind of mud, and the floor of packed dirt, but covered with colorful tapestries. There were small candles - no, oil lamps of some kind - on a low flat rock in the corner, and I smelled something that smelled like... rancid tallow came to mind, but then I realized I didn\\'t even know what that smelled like. And it gave the whole place a certain dimly lighted atmosphere and made the shadows appear so much longer. \\nAnd... I felt a sinking feeling in my gut, because looking at the adobe walls, and the packed dirt floor, and the woven tapestries and oil lamps, and my suit and helmet and gloves sitting on a stool in the corner, I knew one thing.\\nWherever I was, I might just have to get used to being here. Because looking around, I knew that the chances I was leaving, were probably slim to none.\\n \\nWherever I was. Wherever I was from. Whoever I was.\\nEach day passed very like the last. I could now sit up in bed on my own for large parts of the day, and move about a little bit on my wobbly legs. Though the effort temporarily exhausted me, each day I grew a little stronger than the day before. I kept working on it: moving my arms and legs, taxing my core muscles. Eventually I managed to get onto my knees and push myself forward to standing, supported by the side of the bed. Gradually, over a few days, I built up to sitting in a chair for longer periods. When I began to stand on my own I realized how badly my muscles had wasted away, especially my quadriceps, but it felt so good to feel those old leg muscles twitch under my weight. Between visits by my froglike caregivers, in particular the healer\\'s rounds (which could be timed absolutely to level of light in the room, and I also knew that once the healer had visited, it would not be back for a while), I was left to myself.\\nI finally made it over to the stool in the corner, where the spacesuit, helmet, gloves, and the various items - the small radio, the slide rule, and what looked to be a handheld tool - sat, and sitting there before these items, I looked them over.\\nLooking at the helmet and suit brought to mind countless images of other helmets and suits, various makes and types: and my hands twitched looking at the gloves. The helmet had the word \"RENBERG\" stamped on it and my mouth formed the letters, and my heartbeat quickened when I realized what I was looking at. And a glint off the faceplate struck me… and there was a woman staring back at me, and I felt a familiar discomfort in my gut on meeting her dark green eyes. Short gold hair, shorter on the sides: it sat limply on my scalp, having not been washed. Earrings - no, they weren’t earrings, they were polished black plugs, about the circumference of my thumb. My face was stern and plain and rawboned, with high sharp cheekbones, a straight slash of a mouth with no smile lines, and most curious of all - the thin line tattoos that ran down the right side of my face and neck, and then on my chin, tattoos that reminded me of feline markings. I felt… I should feel something about these, but nothing came to me, it was as locked behind a wall of gray fuzz inside my brain as the rest of my memories.\\nMy fingers reached up, shaking, and traced two vertical dark blue lines down the right side of my face, then down my neck, where they formed a simple geometric pattern that ended at my collarbone. This was recent, and still healing. And then there were the thin vertical lines on my chin (four to be precise: two straight short lines, between two longer curved ones), somewhat faded. Those had been there a while.\\nMy heart raced, and I took a deep breath, willing steadiness into myself again. I forced myself to look away from my reflection. \\nI looked down at my arms: and for the first time, it clicked. The bands of ink around my wrists, various glyphs and markings on my arms. I knew somehow that every single mark on my body had some kind of meaning. It all seemed significant somehow, but nothing clicked. \\nI found myself thinking about my breathing: about the time spent doing nothing but breathing before putting on the suit, then, inside the portable potential tomb of a spacesuit, set against hard vacuum, the shallow breaths intended to conserve oxygen.\\nMy mind flashed to the magnetized boots, holding their wearer still while standing on a relay. These memories rushed in upon me like an avalanche of darkening clouds. Whenever walking along the relay, the faint glow of the battery cell within the helmet itself did little to lift the sense of fear, isolation, cold and dark I experienced, when alone, inside the helmet, within the suit.\\nAnd the deep fatigue I experienced was amplified, deepened by the memory of solitude and loneliness. And yet it was comforting. Somehow, inside myself, I knew it to be more comforting sometimes to be outside, just me and the unbending laws of physics and hard vacuum, surrounded by the curtain of stars, than to be inside, among the others. Where nothing else mattered but the task at hand, in the unforgiving nothing of space. \\nPerhaps I am saying something trite and meaningless. Perhaps it is not for me to say whether such an experience was meaningless or not. It was what it was.\\nI ran my hand along the suit\\'s neck ring, and then, rested it on the helmet. I reached to try to lift with both hands. My arms shook. At once I understood the cause of my weakness, my wasted muscles.\\nIt was obvious to me. Before I woke up here, I had been in space. Long enough to lose my strength. Without the drugs to help the body withstand lower G over time - wait, that was a thing! On a ship without a centrifugal force based gravity ring - oh! There was another thing I knew about! It somehow seemed wrong that I should find myself here. \\nI sat with the memories right on the tip of my mind, the way that a word can be said to be on the tip of your tongue, filing through pictures and wondering which were my memories, still uncertain of what was what.\\nI picked up the items: the gloves. Something came to my mind: a painful tenderness in my fingertips, a ghost sensation I could feel in the moment, and pulling a glove off of my hand to find my fingertips raw and bloody, and feeling nothing on it - just the processing of images in my mind of it happening again, again, again. I felt excited, knowing this to be memory. The radio, the slide rule, the tool: I hefted each of these, one and then another, and they had one thing in common. On each of them was a plastic label with embossed, raised writing: \"VAL S. RENBERG.\"\\nThe tool had a button, and a metal latch that seemed like it would be some kind of a safety. I understood somehow not to pick it up, unlatch it, and point it at anything. Not in here. It would have to wait.\\n \\nThere was a final item here, that somehow I had missed in my accounting: a silvery metal ball-chain necklace, with a quarter-inch by quarter-inch... orange metal thing attached to it. It looked like this was some kind of a little container, bisected by a thin seam. I worked my thumbnail into the seam - and the top half of the container detached from the bottom half with a “pop” and slid off, revealing a thin chip of metal inside. It didn\\'t trigger any memories. Obviously it was important or I would not have taken it into space. It would be important to hold onto. I picked it up, and with my arm shaking, slipped it back around my neck.\\nI heard footsteps in the hall, and quickly, made it back to the bed, and back under the covers. I was exhausted by this effort, anyway. \\nAt least I knew who I was: if these were indeed my things, then chances were high that I was in fact called Val S. Renberg. There were a lot of potential reasons it might not be so, but the possibility that this was actually me, seemed as likely as any of them. \\nIt wasn\\'t long before the last ounce of energy left me, and I simply gave in to it. My body shut down. I let it all go. A profound sleep came over me, as if my subconscious could tell I had run out of things to think about.\\n\\n \\\\*\\\\*\\nThe dreams were the strangest things. Sometimes I was in a room, with a flickering, buzzing bright light above me. In every dream, it was the same hard chair. I sat in my chair backwards, leaning the front of my body against the back of the chair, my arms crossed in front of me across the top of the chair’s backrest. The questioner - always a human, always the same younger fair-skinned man with ginger hair - told me he wouldn\\'t talk to me until I sat normally. I rearranged myself in the chair, and finally I was there, trying to find a comfortable position, crossing my legs one direction, then the other.\\n\"Are you ready to give your deposition now, Syndic Renberg?\" the questioner asked.\\n\"What?\" I asked. \"You want to ask me questions?\"\\n\"No, this is a deposition,\" he spoke slowly, emphasizing each word. \"That means I am taking your testimony under oath.\"\\nIf only I were able to read anything in my dreams, to make out the name on his shiny metal nametag, obscured as it was by shadows and the strange reflections from the flickers of the buzzing light overhead. If only I could recognize the faces of those other people who appeared from time to time. But the images would flicker, the questions would stop, and the dreams would end. Or they would become new, different dreams. And then, I\\'d start to tell my side of the story again, and the dream would be over. Each time. At no point in my dream did I ever know what I was being questioned about. In some dreams the room was empty and in some it had some built-in filing cabinets and old posters on the wall portraying the various worlds. There were several other humans present in these dreams, sitting behind the desk or typing away on computers, nodding occasionally at my answers. They always seemed bored, like they really weren\\'t interested in hearing my side of the story.\\n\\nIt was one more of a scattershot, a 52-pick-up of random events recurring in my dreams, sometimes in my tired mind as a reverie, too consistent to not be memories. But unconnected to anything, let alone to each other. As it happened, the last of those dreams had occurred during my captivity, the first after my small froglike hosts had witnessed my return to consciousness. As usual, I awoke drenched in sweat, unable to move. Always there was a sense of dread, of a hollow aching emptiness that stalked me well into the day.\\nBut these were not the only dreams I had.\\nSometimes I was on some strange world full of domed farming settlements. In some parts of the settlement, where the real work went on, knee-high robots skittered about, sometimes telescoping their bodies to reach the higher branches of the trees they picked. And then after walking down a lone narrow path, I was in a room full of humans, all of them not wearing a single stitch of clothing, and most with colorful swirls and flowers painted on their bodies - paint, not tattoo. They laughed among themselves, and sipped their drinks from their handmade ceramic cups, and freely mingled in this room full of exotic plants and colored lights, and some reclined on large cushions on the floor, in groups ranging from two to four. No doubt the heat and humidity in what amounted to a giant domed greenhouse must have driven them to strip down, to allow themselves a chance to cool off. For some reason, in these dreams, I was always looking at their arms and backs for tattoos, and anxious that I didn\\'t see any, for I could deign no sign of what any of these people did, of their individuality, of their loyalties, their work. Always in this dream I felt the walls closing in on me, I felt like I couldn\\'t breathe, and I was trying to get out in a panic but am having to bump against sweaty naked flesh with every inch of progress I make toward the single door. And in the dream I was lost between not wanting any part of their sex party while being insulted that I wasn\\'t invited, and preparing multiple answers in my head about what I\\'m going to reply if they did actually invite me.\\nIn other dreams, I found myself a small child wandering through the dark tunnels beneath my city - but on waking I could never place where that was. It was all twisted corridors, staircases leading nowhere, rooms full of the eerie noises of pipes, steam vents, machinery.In these dreams, I was carrying a thick book full of equations and schematics and blueprints, hurrying down a dark corridor while the city\\'s colorfully lit spires towered above, but I kept my eyes down, avoiding the city\\'s various denizens as I made it to school in the dark. Sometimes I would look up and there would be a huge sign shining down: three proud space travelers with helmets, and what looked to be a symbol I couldn\\'t quite make out, and the thick block letters spelling \"WE’VE GOT THIS.\" This I understood immediately and it was the only thing in any one of my dreams that I could ever read.\\nBut always there was one dream, recurring, that was comforting. In this dream I was standing on a catwalk, on what I recognized to be a shipyard in space. The rumbling of the ships leaving dock, always at the same time, always with the same procedure as they launched. In some of these dreams I was young, an older child standing on these walkways. In some I was an adult wearing a flight suit, standing before a panel of switches and dials. In these dreams I always knew where I was: and in this last one, I was at the shipyard near the barren rock called Point Destruction. I knew what I was supposed to do, and replied during headcount, and I knew what part I played in the fifty-person crew that kept a Massive Container Transport flying intersystem.\\nBut more, in some of these dreams of working in space, there was a large, tall man - or perhaps it\\'s more fair to say that he was a male. Tall pointed, tufted ears and a whiskered muzzle like a lynx\\'s, a long braided mane meticulously tied back in a topknot. Intelligent golden eyes.\\nIn my dreams the sleeves of his flight suit are pushed back to reveal the artfully swirling dark blue tattoos visible through the brown short-trimmed fur on his muscular arms, and his long tail wrapped around a hand-hold to secure himself in microgravity, leaving his hands free. Sometimes I was sitting beside him in a small two-seater in space, listening to him sing in another language... not my native language and nonetheless I understood the words, and sometimes I sang with him.\\nAnd when I woke up from this dream, always, I\\'d try to connect it to something, try to remember something, and... that\\'s that. My memories felt like they were on the tip of my mind the way that a word is said to be on the tip of your tongue.\\nI didn\\'t know what I was remembering, but I knew what emotion I felt when I was awake, and it was a profound sense of homesickness, of belonging somewhere. It was when I had these dreams in particular that I would wake with my chest aching with an emotion I couldn’t find a word for, an empty pit inside I couldn’t name, and couldn’t fill.\\nAnd always on waking, I’d look over at the space suit and helmet and other things in the corner. The suit was damaged beyond usability; it only took a single examination and a double-check to feel safe concluding that my small froglike hosts had cut me out of it. \\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\nMy recovery felt painfully slow. Each day I pushed myself further than the day before. Each day they fed me the same bitter hot drink and the same thick milky gruel five times a day, insisting I take it, and though I tried hard not to gag on it because it had roughly the same consistency and taste as phlegm, I made myself swallow it because for all I knew, no other food was coming. Besides, I was getting stronger. And I was alive. That alone gave me hope.\\nMy legs no longer shook after standing on them for five minutes, and each day I\\'d been able to stand, and walk around, just a bit more. Now - roughly four days into my regaining consciousness in this small room - I was going to find out where I was.\\nOver the next few hours, I watched each of my hosts come and go from the room: first the short one, then the fat one, then the tall healer and their assistant. Following the healer\\'s departure, I would be left alone for some hours, and if it were like any other day, then the hall would be clear for a while.\\nI silently counted in my mind, backward from 200, after I\\'d heard the last of the healer\\'s and apprentice\\'s footfalls fade from view, and then I sat up, grabbing the coverlet from the bed and tying it around my body so that it covered my torso, hanging free down to my knees.\\nAnd then I stood, stepping from one foot to the other, on the balls of my feet, as lightly as I could manage, and quietly, I grabbed one of the oil-lamps from the floor and I stepped from the room, and assessed my environment. The ceiling being barely a few inches above my head, I ducked my head when I stepped out the door.\\nThe walls here were some type of stone, bare of paint or decorations. There were a few other open, arch-shaped doorways like the one I\\'d come through, but I saw no sign of windows. Was I underground? Most of the rooms were empty, though I heard - a few doors down - the faint chittering and trilling of frog-people talking to each other. It was a comfortable temperature here, just slightly warm. I thought it best to go in the opposite direction of the chittering frog-people down the hall, and as I crept down the hall, I spotted another open doorway immediately to the right of the doorway from which I\\'d emerged, and what looked to be some kind of cabinet or store room - I stepped just inside the door, holding my oil lamp in any direction I wanted to look in.\\nThe place was very clean and tidy, the shelves well-organized, stacked neatly in rows and columns. Handmade ceramic bowls of what looked to be various electronic parts and widgets - wires, bolts, nuts. The shelf beneath held rows of smaller objects, both familiar in form and not: pieces of machinery and gears and wheels that seemed to be the common shape of so many bipedal, bilateral symmetry species\\' pre-spacefaring industrial technology. But it was what lay behind the rows of neatly stacked objects and arranged ceramic bowls that caught my attention. Pieces of milky crystal, ranging in size from my thumb to the size of my arm. I set my oil-lamp down onto the shelf, and I picked up one of the smaller crystals and held it up to the light, turning it over to look at every aspect of it; it wasn\\'t raw rock crystal but instead somehow machine-tooled. Finally there was a larger bowl sitting on this shelf, and there was an assortment in it that was hearteningly familiar: objects that looked carved from crystal themselves, some from something that resembled obsidian, but were unmistakably tools. Tools of various shapes and sizes, crude implements and even ornate devices made by someone who had seen their work, who cared about making beautiful and functional tools. All these objects looked centuries old. My eyes drifted over the surface of a small object I held in my hand: a fine pointed stone meant to cut things precisely but which, I thought in the moment, could probably be used to pry, or - should I encounter anything resembling a screw - in the place of a flathead screwdriver, though I already had one on my multitool. There was a pair of tarnished metal goggles here, too - the metal resembled brass - with dark lenses. The band was makeshift, made of two strips of braided cloth meant to be tied at the back of the head. Where could these have come from? Did these people grind glass, or...\\nI lifted the goggles to my face, and then tied the two straps behind my head, and looked around. The lenses cut the light by half, and were surprisingly lightweight. I lifted them back up to my forehead, and continued to look around. This place had tools! Some scrapers, pliers, knives. And on top of all that, some weird objects I didn\\'t recognize, although they reminded me of a sort of gardening tool, with two tines at the end. Finally, satisfied with what I saw, I turned around, to look at the shelves on the other side of me. But as I did, I startled suddenly as something trilled softly behind me.\\nI jumped backwards, stumbling, catching myself before I fell. It was one of the frog-people: the healer\\'s tall, thin apprentice.\\n\"Rrrr?\" it trilled again, and within moments, two other of the frog-people emerged behind it.\\n\"Shit,\" I said aloud, holding my hands up in front of me. \"Look, don\\'t worry about it.\"\\nI remembered the goggles on top of my head, and reached for them, putting them back on the shelf behind me, then turning, holding my hands up. \"Sorry!\" I called out. \"Just curious is all.\"\\n\"Rrrr?\" one of the frog-people said, sounding hesitant.\\n\"Oh, I\\'m sorry!\" I exclaimed, \"You must think I\\'m really rude. You know, exploring places where you\\'re not supposed to...\"\\n\"Rrrr.\"\\n\"I\\'ll go back to my room.\"\\n\"Rrrr.\"\\n\"Well, thanks anyway,\" I said, nodding awkwardly, and I backed away from the shelf, holding my hands up. They moved aside to let me pass, then disappeared into the shadows beyond. I breathed a sigh of relief, then looked down the hall I\\'d just come from, toward the sounds of chatter from the other end. But I thought the better of it, and headed back toward my room. And there, in the middle of the room, the healer stood, holding its staff. I stood still, and the healer looked over me, up and down, and finally, it brought its three-fingered hands to its eyes, and made the shape of goggles. \"Rrr?\"\\nI put my hands up to my face, copying the gesture. \"Rrr.\"\\nIt held up a hand, then brought its other hand over, making a gesture as if to hold one of the small tools I\\'d just examined in the storeroom, and it turned the hand as if turning the tool. \"Rr?\"\\nI repeated the gesture, imagining the tool in my hand. I had no idea what I was telling them. Just that it seemed natural.\\nAnd finally, the healer stood, and said nothing for a long time, but turned toward its assistant and two other frog-people, who stood in the doorway, and chirped at them, and they cleared out of the way as two other frog-people emerged. They were dragging something. I watched, intrigued. The large object made a dragging sound against the floor. It looked like some kind of clumsily assembled mannequin, or...\\nI looked closer. It lacked a head, and loose connectors and stiff wires stuck out from its neck, and what\\'s more, was that it appeared to be assembled of mismatched bits, a clear plastic panel here, a metal panel there...\\nIt was a robot.\\nAnd I sat with this for a moment, while the healer looked at me, then repeated the “tool using” gesture with its hands that I had copied just a moment before.\\nI considered all of the information available to me - the various bits and bobs of technology in the storeroom that somehow didn’t fit with the Neolithic conditions in which I was being kept, that didn’t seem to fit any one coherent pattern or aesthetic to indicate a single technological base, and now, there was a broken robot hauled in front of me.\\nI glanced over at the spacesuit in the corner, and considered the slide rule (probably a foreign object to them) and the multitool (similar enough to other tools that were in that storeroom) that had been there among my things, and that these people had - I presumed - pulled me from a wrecked vessel. And now - I was sure - I was being kept in an underground facility.\\nI felt safe in assuming the frog-people to be scavenging technology, and possibly hiding it.\\nMy gut clenched in dread. I had to get to the outside. I had to know where I was. I had to know where I had come from.\\nI looked back at the headless robot. “I’m just going to have to try,” I said to no one in particular. \\nIt rolled off of my tongue as if I’d said this many, many times before, and the clench in my gut told me that enough of those times, I’d tried and failed, and that the failures mattered gravely. \\n\\nWANDERER CHAPTER 3\\nALEX WEINBERG \\nAs soon as they were gone, I turned away from the robot and hurried over to the wall of shelves along the back wall. Several things caught my eye, but not a single thing was anything I recognized. At least the actual raw materials were familiar: random bits of copper and crystal, various rings and washers of some kind of rubberlike material. Not here, nor in the storeroom, had I run into anything resemble the circuit testers I saw pictures of in my mind, as if the memory were there, waiting. This didn\\'t mean they weren\\'t available somewhere, I reminded myself. It only meant that I hadn\\'t found them yet. Or that they didn\\'t look anything like what we had back home… wherever “home” happened to be. I wondered what they looked like, then shook my head to clear it. It didn\\'t matter; what mattered was getting this working again.\\n\"I need a manual,\" I muttered, shaking my head. \"Well. Better know what I\\'m getting myself into.\"\\n\\nI had no way to judge the time, but estimated that I sat for a few hours, just staring at the robot, even as my bladder ached. I\\'d examined the thing up and down, looking for some kind of seam, trying to deign some kind of clue as to this contraption\\'s assemblage. Some of it seemed... random. Its arms didn\\'t seem to match - the left had a clear plastic-looking casing wherein you could see the wires and servos inside, and the right was articulated chrome. And in the middle of its chest sat a plate with what I can only presume was a socket into which could be attached a third arm. It didn\\'t look like it went with the rest of the robot. Who was the original maker of this thing? Was it getting salvaged again, again, added onto again and again? What even powered this thing? Why? There was no obvious power source or plug of any kind. No wires coming out anywhere, nothing plugged into the front, none of the obvious stuff. These were all questions I asked myself over and over again, trying to put together the puzzle. Could I reach up, unscrew anything? Was there anything that came apart from anything else? And if I did, what might happen if I opened something that wasn\\'t supposed to be opened? I felt nervous enough already, thinking about how easily this could break, given the wrong circumstances.\\n\"Shit,\" I muttered to myself.\\nI don\\'t know how long I sat there, just staring at the robot. I know that two helpings of the frog-people\\'s nutri-slime had been placed next to me, spaced some time apart, and that they\\'d also brought me drinking bowls of hot water. I did manage to get up to relieve myself twice. And then returned to the robot, looking it up and down, detaching this or that limb as I could, and feeling anywhere I could for some kind of a seam.\\n\\nAnd there it was... something that resembled a plate with a seam. I reached under one side of the plate, digging my short fingernails into the seam, and... there. The plate popped off, landing on the floor at my feet. And under it, was a tangle of wires, obscuring a... row of familiar looking switches. Well, whoever built this thing, clearly thought and built in binary... and thought to build a robot with humanoid arms, humanoid legs. Except binary wasn\\'t even necessarily the norm among all humanoids. I sighed in frustration and exhaustion because the insides were as much of a mismatched hodge-podge as the outsides, and whoev er worked on this thing before, had terrible cable management. A little of this wire here, a bit of that wire there, half buried, almost covered by another wire... like an art project gone awry. This place looked like someone threw everything in the house that would fit in here and set it to a robotic assembler to work on it, until the person finally came back to pick it up. Who knows. I bent down, poking around through the wires, poking and prodding and pushing. After some effort, I found one end of the main wire running out of the torso section of the machine. And with some searching, I located another piece of loose wire going to the base.\\nI traced it back to where it would be connected, and... no. The wrong kind of connector. Whatever the other end was supposed to be doing, this was not it. I rubbed my eyes. I was ready to cry from frustration when I walked back to my room, and as soon as I sat down on the mat that passed for a bed, I felt the heaviest weariness sink into my bones, making my body feel heavy. I don\\'t remember leaning back onto the bed and falling asleep, that\\'s how exhausted I was. \\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nMy dreams that night were as strange as any the nights before. In those dreams, I\\'m with him again, on that little yellow ship. The large feline man who sings in his language every time he pulls the little yellow two-seater out of its berth. First he takes a small bag - some kind of leather, from the looks of it - from the inside of his shirt, and affixes it to the instrument panel. Then he unwinds the bracelet he always wears - a length of braid, like braided hair - and wraps that around the throttle. Pilots and navigators, always such a superstitious lot. But it\\'s what he always does next that fascinates me: each step in his song, goes to a specific pre-flight check. I have to listen closely to follow along. By the time we are in the cockpit again, we\\'re both suited up, and we\\'re underway. The cockpit is silent save for the low humming of the engines, and his soft humming over his helmet\\'s speaker. It\\'s such a simple song, and yet each time, it carries us forward with the utmost precision. Somehow this time I am singing with him. And then it comes into view, Ansible Relay 44\\'s miles of panels. This time, I know the song. I know what every step in this process is, and it\\'s come to give me comfort, too, in its never-changingness. For as far as I can remember, he has sung these steps with the same accuracy. It doesn\\'t matter whether I know them, or whether he chooses to explain them. The meaning behind them remains constant. So it will go. Always forward. I will step out of this little ship, my magnetized boots holding me fast to the relay. And when I return to the little yellow ship, I\\'ll find that my feline companion - his name is Kesh, I think - has been singing this whole time, singing me back. And I will ask him about it. And he will glance away from me, chuckle slightly, and say \"I would only not sing you back if I meant to leave you out on that relay.\"\\nAnd somehow, that means something to me, because somehow I know that there haven\\'t been that many people I would trust not to. But I trust him.\\nAnd then seemingly all at once, I\\'m in a small compartment with him, the kind you can get for shared quarters on a Massive Container Transport - somehow in my dreams, I know this. I am laying on the rack beside him, curled against him, my head resting in the crook of his shoulder. He takes my hand, twining my fingers in his, then finally, raising it up to his furry cheek, pressing my hand down the grain of his feline whiskers. There is a deep rumbling in his broad furry chest, and my fingers trace the tabby stripes of his shoulders and face. We stay like that for some time, my head against his fur, the feeling of it beneath my chin warm and comforting. At last, he releases my hand, turning it so that I can lay it on his heart. And it\\'s there I know the feeling for what it is: love. He reaches over, touching the faint lines tattooed on my chin, that resemble his own. My fingers find the braid of hair wound in a bracelet around his wrist - my golden hair braided with the hairs of his darker, courser mane. It has the feel of fine cord. \"R\\'Kesh,\" I whisper, and he turns to me.\\n\\nAnd it\\'s just then that the dream ended, and I was awake.\\nR\\'Kesh. The name repeated too often to not be his name. He was the first person I remembered since awakening here, and the feeling in my chest told me who he was. My mate, and he was out there… somewhere. And I was here. Wherever “here” was.',\n",

Some partners, with their own concerns about Chinese participation in supply chains, may not need much incentive.\\n\\nAn administration and Congress—both motivated by unfair Chinese competition—should be able to agree on pursuing such negotiations under the Trade Promotion Authority, through which Congress gives the president negotiation instructions in exchange for an up-or-down vote on any deal.

In 2020, Beijing restricted trade with Australia as punishment for Canberra’s desire to investigate COVID-19’s origins.

It provides opportunities for engineering students to overcome their current learning weaknesses and aims to close the learning gap for students to achieve course objectives (Subheesh & Sethy, 2020). Engineering students currently engage in feedback activities from receiving feedback from teachers for assessments and providing peer evaluations to other students. However, the feedback itself can be a time-consuming process for teachers and their provided feedback was often labelled as limited (Vardi, 2009). An AI-automated feedback tool can be utilized to enhance the feedback experience for engineering students. It allows real-time feedback for students and can provide feasible individual feedback to all students in a large engineering faculty (Deeva et al., 2021). Engineering students will be able to enhance their feedback literacy to understand and create dispositions from feedback to strengthen their learning (Carless & Boud, 2018). With real-time feedback generated from an AI feedback tool, engineering students will be able to engage in student-centered learning to gain a sense of direction for their learning and become self-paced with their studies (Tubino & Adachi, 2022). However, there is little understanding of the potential use of an AI-automated feedback tool for feedback to engineering students. In this research, surveys will be conducted and analyzed to examine the benefits of an AI feedback tool in engineering education.\"',\n",

In this guide, learn the benefits of a low-carb diet and how to incorporate it into your lifestyle for fast weight loss results.\\n\\nIntroduction:\\nLosing weight can be a difficult and frustrating process, but with the right approach, it doesn\\'t have to be. One effective way to lose weight quickly is by following a low-carb diet plan. By cutting down on carbs, you can reduce your calorie intake and trigger your body to burn stored fat for energy, leading to rapid weight loss.\\n\\nIn this guide, we\\'ll discuss the benefits of a low-carb diet, how to start one, and what to expect as you progress. By the end, you\\'ll have all the information you need to lose weight quickly and effectively with a low-carb diet plan.\\n\\n\"What is a Low-Carb Diet?\"\\nA low-carb diet is a type of diet that restricts the consumption of carbohydrates, such as sugar, bread, pasta, and rice. Instead, you focus on eating protein-rich foods, healthy fats, and vegetables. By limiting your carb intake, your body is forced to switch from using glucose (carbohydrates) as its primary energy source to using stored fat for energy.\\n\\n\"Why a Low-Carb Diet is Effective for Weight Loss\"\\nThere are several reasons why a low-carb diet is effective for weight loss.\\n\\n1. Reduces Calorie Intake: By cutting down on carbohydrates, you automatically reduce your calorie intake, leading to weight loss.\\n2. Triggers Fat Burning: When your body runs out of carbohydrates to use as energy, it begins to burn stored fat for energy instead.\\n3. Reduces Appetite: Low-carb diets have been shown to reduce hunger and increase feelings of fullness, making it easier to stick to a diet and avoid overeating.\\n\\n\"How to Start a Low-Carb Diet Plan\"\\nStarting a low-carb diet plan can be easy if you follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Plan Your Meals: Make a list of low-carb meals and snacks that you enjoy and that fit your lifestyle.\\n2. Stock Your Kitchen: Get rid of high-carb foods and stock up on low-carb ingredients, such as vegetables, protein-rich foods, and healthy fats.\\n3. Count Your Carbs: Keep track of the number of carbohydrates you\\'re consuming each day and make sure to stay within your daily limit.\\n4. Be Prepared: Pack low-carb snacks for when you\\'re on-the-go and have low-carb options available for when you eat out.\\n\\n\"What to Expect When Following a Low-Carb Diet Plan\"\\nWhen following a low-carb diet plan, you can expect:\\n\\n1. Rapid Weight Loss: You can expect to lose weight quickly, especially in the first few weeks, as your body switches from using glucose to using stored fat for energy.\\n2. Energy Boost: As your body becomes more efficient at using fat for energy, you may experience increased energy levels.\\n3. Increased Satiety: Low-carb diets have been shown to reduce hunger and increase feelings of fullness, making it easier to stick to a diet and avoid overeating.\\n4. Possible Side Effects: Some people may experience side effects, such as headaches, fatigue, and constipation, when starting a low-carb diet. These side effects are usually temporary and can be managed with proper hydration and nutrient supplementation.\\n\\n\"'},\n",

Unlike negative protocols, which emphasize error detection and handling, positive protocols prioritize reliable and efficient data transmission by acknowledging the receipt of error-free data packets and using techniques such as error correction and flow control.\\n\\nKey features of a positive protocol include:\\n\\n1. Positive acknowledgment: In a positive protocol, the receiver sends a positive acknowledgment (ACK) to the sender after successfully receiving a data packet. This confirms that the packet was received without errors and enables the sender to transmit the next packet in the sequence.\\n2. Error correction: Positive protocols often use error correction techniques, such as forward error correction (FEC), to detect and correct errors in data packets without requiring retransmission. This can improve the efficiency of data transmission, especially in networks with high error rates or long round-trip times.\\n3. Flow control: Positive protocols may implement flow control mechanisms to regulate the rate at which data is transmitted between sender and receiver. Flow control helps prevent network congestion and ensures that the receiver can process incoming data at an appropriate rate.\\n4. Retransmission: Although positive protocols focus on ensuring successful data transmission, they may still include provisions for retransmission in case of errors. If the receiver detects an error in a data packet or does not receive an expected packet, it can request retransmission using selective acknowledgment (SACK) or a similar mechanism.\\n5. Efficiency: Positive protocols are typically more efficient than negative protocols in situations with high error rates or long round-trip times, as they prioritize reliable data delivery and minimize the need for retransmissions.\\n6. Examples: Some examples of positive protocols include the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which is widely used in the Internet for reliable data transmission, and selective repeat ARQ (Automatic Repeat Request), which combines positive acknowledgment with selective retransmission of erroneous data packets.\\n\\nIn summary, a positive protocol is a communication protocol that focuses on ensuring successful and efficient data transmission by acknowledging error-free data packets, using error correction techniques, and implementing flow control mechanisms. Positive protocols are generally more efficient than negative protocols in networks with high error rates or long round-trip times, although they can be more complex to implement.'},\n",

In systems with focusing, the proof search process is organized around the polarities of the formulas, allowing the prover to focus on one polarity at a time. This reduces non-determinism and backtracking, making the proof search more efficient.\\n\\nBipolarity refers to the presence of both positive and negative subformulas within a single formula. A bipolar formula combines aspects of both positive and negative polarities, which can complicate the proof search process and the interaction between subformulas in a proof.\\n\\nThe relationship between focusing and bipolarity can be seen in the following ways:\\n\\n1. Focusing helps manage bipolarity: In systems with focusing, the proof search process is designed to handle formulas with mixed polarities more effectively. By focusing on one polarity at a time, the prover can more easily navigate the complexities introduced by bipolar formulas.\\n2. Bipolarity affects focusing strategies: The presence of bipolar formulas can have implications for proof search and proof normalization strategies in systems with focusing. For example, a formula that combines positive and negative polarities may require more complex strategies to balance the interactions between subformulas during the proof search process.\\n3. Insights into logical systems: Studying the relationship between focusing and bipolarity can provide valuable insights into the structure and behavior of formal systems.

Each approach has its advantages and disadvantages, and they are often used in different contexts depending on the specific requirements of the logical system being studied.\\n\\nHypersequents:\\n\\n1. Hypersequents are a generalization of sequents, where a sequent is a relation between a set of formulas (antecedent) and a single formula (succedent). In a hypersequent, there are multiple sequents separated by a special symbol, often represented as a semicolon or a comma.\\n2. Hypersequents are used to represent and reason about non-classical logics, such as modal logics, intuitionistic logics, and substructural logics. They provide a way to express complex relationships between formulas that cannot be captured using traditional sequents.\\n3. Hypersequents are particularly useful for dealing with logics that involve multiple conclusions or that exhibit a certain degree of non-determinism in the proof search process. They can also be used to encode structural rules, like the exchange rule or the contraction rule, that are not available in some non-classical logics.\\n4. One of the main challenges when working with hypersequents is that they can become quite complex, as they involve multiple sequents and a potentially large number of formulas. This can make the proof search process more difficult and increase the complexity of proof systems.\\n\\nLinear systems:\\n\\n1. Linear systems are a type of proof system based on the principles of linear logic, which is a substructural logic that distinguishes between linear and non-linear resources. In linear systems, formulas are treated as resources, and the structure of the proof system is designed to reflect the consumption and manipulation of these resources.\\n2. Linear systems are particularly useful for reasoning about resource-sensitive problems, such as concurrency, state transitions, and resource allocation. They can also be used to study logics with limited structural rules, like the absence of contraction or weakening.\\n3. One of the main advantages of linear systems is that they provide a simple and intuitive way to reason about the flow of resources in a logical system. By treating formulas as resources, linear systems can provide insights into the underlying structure and behavior of the logic.\\n4. A challenge when working with linear systems is that they can be less expressive than other proof systems, such as sequent calculus or natural deduction. This is because linear systems restrict the use of structural rules and may not be able to represent certain types of relationships between formulas.\\n\\nIn summary, hypersequents and linear systems are two different approaches in proof theory that are used to represent and reason about logical formulas and their relationships. Hypersequents are a generalization of sequents that can represent complex relationships in non-classical logics, while linear systems are based on the principles of linear logic and focus on resource-sensitive reasoning.

Create a database: Once you're connected to PostgreSQL, you can create a database using the `CREATE DATABASE` command. For example:\\n```sql\\nCREATE DATABASE EstateMall;\\n```\\n4. Connect to the database: After creating the database, you need to connect to it using the `\\\\c` command. For example:\\n```r\\n\\\\c EstateMall;\\n```\\n5. Create tables: Once you're connected to the database, you can create tables to store your data. For example, you might create a table for properties, with columns for property ID, address, and price, among others.\\n```sql\\nCREATE TABLE properties (\\n  property_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\\n  address VARCHAR(255),\\n  price DECIMAL(10,2),\\n  ...\\n);\\n```\\n6. Populate the tables: You can then insert data into the tables using the `INSERT INTO` command.\\n```sql\\nINSERT INTO properties (address, price, ...)\\nVALUES ('123 Main St', 500000, ...);\\n```\\nThese are the general steps for creating a database using PostgreSQL.

       "  'output': \"It sounds like you may have an issue with the combined load of the two circuits on your power supply, or there could be a problem with the way you are connecting the circuits together. Here are a few possibilities that could cause the LED in the current detector circuit to burn out:\\n\\n1. Overvoltage: When both circuits are connected to the same power supply, the combined load might cause the voltage to rise, leading to overvoltage in the current detector circuit. Make sure your power supply can handle the combined current draw of both circuits without causing a significant change in output voltage.\\n2. Incorrect wiring: Double-check your connections when combining the circuits to ensure that you aren't inadvertently connecting the LED in the current detector circuit to a higher voltage than intended. For example, make sure you're not connecting the LED directly to the power supply voltage without a current-limiting resistor in series.\\n3. Grounding issue: If the ground connection is shared between the two circuits, make sure it is stable and can handle the combined current flow. A poor ground connection can cause unexpected voltage drops or rises, which could lead to the LED burning out.\\n4. Incompatible components: Ensure that the LED in the current detector circuit is compatible with the voltage and current levels when both circuits are connected. If necessary, replace the LED with one that has a higher voltage or current rating, or add a current-limiting resistor in series with the LED to protect it from excessive current.\\n\\nTo prevent the LED from burning out, double-check your connections, verify your power supply can handle the combined load, and ensure your components are compatible. If you still have issues, consider using a separate power supply for each circuit or using an isolation circuit, like an optocoupler, to separate the two circuits electrically while still allowing them to interact.\"},\n",

Some websites use techniques such as disabling right-click or disabling the developer tools to prevent users from copying content or inspecting elements on their website.\\n4. Keyboard Layout: Depending on your keyboard layout, the shortcut for opening the developer tools could be different. For example, on a Mac, the shortcut is Command + Option + I instead of Ctrl + Shift + I.\\n\\nIf none of the above solutions work, you can try opening the developer tools manually.

The GameSession class is responsible for tracking session-related data such as the session name, number of players, maximum players, and other settings.\\n\\n`AGameSession` is used by default in UE4 when hosting and joining sessions, and it is usually automatically instantiated and managed by the GameMode. You can create your own custom GameSession class to extend or override the default behavior when needed. This might be useful when you want to:\\n\\n1. Customize the process of creating, starting, and ending game sessions.\\n2. Add server-side validation of player connections (e.g., checking player credentials or banning players).\\n3. Manage server-side session settings, such as server name, map rotation, or game rules.\\n\\nTo create a custom GameSession, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. Create a new class that inherits from `AGameSession`:\\n```cpp\\n// MyGameSession.h\\n#pragma once\\n\\n#include \"CoreMinimal.h\"\\n#include \"GameFramework/GameSession.h\"\\n#include \"MyGameSession.generated.h\"\\n\\nUCLASS()\\nclass MYGAME_API AMyGameSession : public AGameSession\\n{\\n    GENERATED_BODY()\\n\\npublic:\\n    // Override or add new functions and properties as needed\\n};\\n```\\n1.

Now you can override or add new functions in your custom GameSession class to implement your desired functionality.\\n\\nFor example, you might want to override the `ApproveLogin` function in your custom GameSession class to add server-side validation of player connections:\\n```cpp\\n// MyGameSession.h\\nUCLASS()\\nclass MYGAME_API AMyGameSession : public AGameSession\\n{\\n    GENERATED_BODY()\\n\\npublic:\\n    virtual bool ApproveLogin(const FString& Options, const FUniqueNetId& UniqueId, const FString& Address, const FText& ErrorMessage) override;\\n};\\n\\n// MyGameSession.cpp\\nbool AMyGameSession::ApproveLogin(const FString& Options, const FUniqueNetId& UniqueId, const FString& Address, const FText& ErrorMessage)\\n{\\n    // Perform custom validation here\\n    // For example, check if the player is banned\\n\\n    // If the validation fails, return false to reject the connection\\n    // return false;\\n\\n    // If the validation passes, call the parent function to approve the login\\n    return Super::ApproveLogin(Options, UniqueId, Address, ErrorMessage);\\n}\\n```\\nIn summary, `AGameSession` is a key component for managing game sessions in Unreal Engine 4, and you should use it when you need to customize the behavior of game sessions or perform server-side validation of player connections.'},\n",

Create a custom `UIViewRepresentable` to wrap the `SCNView`:\\n```swift\\nstruct SceneKitView: UIViewRepresentable {\\n    func makeUIView(context: Context) -> SCNView {\\n        let scnView = SCNView()\\n        scnView.scene = SCNScene()\\n        scnView.autoenablesDefaultLighting = true\\n        scnView.allowsCameraControl = true\\n        return scnView\\n    }\\n\\n    func updateUIView(_ uiView: SCNView, context: Context) {}\\n}\\n```\\n1. Add the black hole sphere and accretion disk to the scene:\\n```swift\\nfunc addBlackHoleAndAccretionDisk(to scene: SCNScene) {\\n    // Create black hole sphere\\n    let blackHoleGeometry = SCNSphere(radius: 1.0)\\n    let blackHoleMaterial = SCNMaterial()\\n    blackHoleMaterial.diffuse.contents = UIColor.black\\n    blackHoleGeometry.materials = [blackHoleMaterial]\\n    let blackHoleNode = SCNNode(geometry: blackHoleGeometry)\\n    scene.rootNode.addChildNode(blackHoleNode)\\n\\n    // Create accretion disk\\n    let accretionDiskGeometry = SCNTorus(ringRadius: 2.5, pipeRadius: 0.2)\\n    let accretionDiskMaterial = SCNMaterial()\\n    accretionDiskMaterial.diffuse.contents = UIColor.red\\n    accretionDiskGeometry.materials = [accretionDiskMaterial]\\n    let accretionDiskNode = SCNNode(geometry: accretionDiskGeometry)\\n    scene.rootNode.addChildNode(accretionDiskNode)\\n}\\n```\\n1. Add a camera to the scene:\\n```swift\\nfunc addCamera(to scene: SCNScene) {\\n    let cameraNode = SCNNode()\\n    cameraNode.camera = SCNCamera()\\n    cameraNode.position = SCNVector3(x: 0, y: 10, z: 10)\\n    cameraNode.eulerAngles = SCNVector3(x: -.pi / 4, y: 0, z: 0)\\n    scene.rootNode.addChildNode(cameraNode)\\n}\\n```\\n1. Modify the `makeUIView` function to set up the scene:\\n```swift\\nfunc makeUIView(context: Context) -> SCNView {\\n    let scnView = SCNView()\\n    let scene = SCNScene()\\n    scnView.scene = scene\\n    scnView.autoenablesDefaultLighting = true\\n    scnView.allowsCameraControl = true\\n\\n    addBlackHoleAndAccretionDisk(to: scene)\\n    addCamera(to: scene)\\n\\n    return scnView\\n}\\n```\\n1. In your SwiftUI `View`, use the custom `SceneKitView`:\\n```swift\\nstruct ContentView: View {\\n    var body: some View {\\n        SceneKitView()\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\nNow, you have a simple scene with a black hole and an accretion disk. To add gravitational lensing, you'll need to create custom shaders or use third-party libraries, which may require extensive knowledge of graphics programming. The shader will be responsible for bending the light around the black hole and creating the lensing effect. You can look into Metal and GLSL shaders for this purpose.\"},\n",

       "  'output': 'To ensure Metal is properly configured in your iOS or macOS app, follow these steps:\\n\\n1. **Enable Metal in your project:**\\nIn Xcode, navigate to your project settings by clicking on the project file in the Project Navigator. Select the app target, and under the \"General\" tab, check the \"Metal\" framework is included in the \"Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content\" section. If it\\'s not there, click the \"+\" button and search for \"Metal\" to add it to your project.\\n2. **Create an MTLDevice:**\\nTo use Metal, you\\'ll need to create an `MTLDevice` instance. The device represents the GPU and is responsible for creating and managing resources like textures, buffers, and shaders.\\n\\nIn Swift, you can create an MTLDevice like this:\\n```swift\\nimport Metal\\n\\nguard let device = MTLCreateSystemDefaultDevice() else {\\n    fatalError(\"Failed to create Metal device\")\\n}\\n```\\n3. **Set up a Metal view:**\\nFor rendering Metal content, you need a view that uses Metal for drawing. If you\\'re using SceneKit, you can use `SCNView`, which has built-in support for Metal rendering. Make sure to set the view\\'s `preferredRenderingAPI` to `.metal` before initializing the view.\\n\\nIf you\\'re using Metal directly, use `MTKView`, a subclass of `UIView` (iOS) or `NSView` (macOS) that can render Metal content. When you create an `MTKView`, pass the `MTLDevice` instance you created earlier:\\n```swift\\nimport MetalKit\\n\\nlet metalView = MTKView(frame: view.bounds, device: device)\\nview.addSubview(metalView)\\n```\\n4. **Create shaders:**\\nWrite your shaders using the Metal Shading Language (MSL) and save them in a `.metal` file in your project. Xcode will automatically compile these shaders into a default Metal library when building your app.\\n5. **Load the shader functions and create a pipeline:**\\nTo use the shaders in your app, load them from the default Metal library, and create a render pipeline with the appropriate vertex and fragment functions:\\n```swift\\nlet defaultLibrary = device.makeDefaultLibrary()\\nlet vertexFunction = defaultLibrary?.makeFunction(name: \"vertexShader\")\\nlet fragmentFunction = defaultLibrary?.makeFunction(name: \"fragmentShader\")\\n\\nlet pipelineDescriptor = MTLRenderPipelineDescriptor()\\npipelineDescriptor.vertexFunction = vertexFunction\\npipelineDescriptor.fragmentFunction = fragmentFunction\\npipelineDescriptor.colorAttachments[0].pixelFormat = .bgra8Unorm\\n\\ndo {\\n    let pipelineState = try device.makeRenderPipelineState(descriptor: pipelineDescriptor)\\n} catch let error {\\n    fatalError(\"Failed to create pipeline state: \\\\(error.localizedDescription)\")\\n}\\n```\\n6. **Create buffers and textures:**\\nUse the `MTLDevice` instance to create buffers and textures that your shaders will use as input or output.\\n7. **Render your content:**\\nSet up your render pass descriptor, configure the render encoder with your pipeline state, and issue draw calls using the Metal command buffer and command queue.\\n\\nEnsure you follow these steps and set up your Metal rendering pipeline correctly. If you\\'re using a third-party framework or library, consult its documentation for additional configuration requirements. If you run into issues or errors, please provide more context or code snippets for further assistance.'},\n",

Recently, through a Google Scholar Alert, I was delighted to discover your pre-registered study, \"A Multidimensional Quiet Quitting Scale: Development and Test of a Measure of Quiet Quitting.\" Your proposed two-dimensional approach to Quiet Quitting, encompassing both emotional and behavioral aspects, truly resonated with me.\\n\\nSouth Korea is witnessing various social changes due to rapid economic growth, and Quiet Quitting is becoming increasingly prevalent, particularly among millennials and Generation Z. This growing phenomenon has piqued the interest of human resources managers, who seek to understand its potential impact on organizational performance. As such, there is a burgeoning need for research in this area.\\n\\nI am eager to request your permission to conduct a validation study of the MQQS in the Korean context.

Each program should have a \"Learn More\" button that takes the user to the program landing page.\\n2. Program landing page: The program landing page should have more detailed information about the program, including its duration, schedule, and pricing. The user should be able to apply for the program by clicking on a \"Apply Now\" button. If the user is not a paid subscriber, they should be prompted to subscribe before applying.\\n3. Application form: The application form should capture basic information about the user, such as name, email address, and phone number. The user should also be asked to provide some background information, such as their level of experience with trading and investing. The user should be able to submit the application form once they have filled in all the required fields.\\n4. Program progress page: Once the user has been accepted into the program, they should be redirected to a program progress page. This page should display their progress in the program, including the topics covered and the assignments completed. The user should be able to see their progress in real-time, and also be able to download any materials they need.\\n5. Recorded content: The program progress page should also have links to the recorded content for each class. The user should be able to access the recordings from the program progress page, and should also be able to download them for offline viewing.\\n6. Live class: If the user is attending a live class, they should be able to join the class from the program progress page. The user should be able to see the class schedule, and should also be able to set reminders for upcoming classes.\\n7. Cohort leaderboard: The program progress page should also have a cohort leaderboard that displays the rankings of all the participants in the program.

The Tribunal further determined that because the appellant had already replaced the windows once, the replacement of the appellant’s windows with windows from a different manufacturer was a reasonable course to adopt.\\n\\nThe Tribunal accepted that the respondents could not afford to wait, that the parties were “unlikely to narrow the issues in dispute” and that the appellant rejected the proposition that the windows had been defectively re-manufactured. The Tribunal determined that in those circumstances it was reasonable for the respondents to order new windows from a third party supplier and rejected the appellant’s submission that the respondents had failed to mitigate their loss.\\n\\nThe Tribunal accepted the evidence of Mr Brennan over that of Mr Sim (the expert called by the appellant) because Mr Brennan was the more experienced expert in respect of window manufacture and installation. The Tribunal also found that Mr Sim’s opinion should be given lesser weight because he had “adopted the Schlegel test” which the Tribunal accepted is not the appropriate test for windows “fitted on site into a timber frame with lightweight external cladding”.\\n\\nThe Tribunal generally found the evidence of the lay witnesses, Mr Sibilia and Mr Pawa (who gave evidence on behalf of the appellant) not to be persuasive in relation to the cause of the leaks.\\n\\nThe Tribunal found the appellant liable for the reasonable cost of rectification of the leaking windows and awarded the respondents:\\n\\nThe amount of an invoice from Wideline Pty Ltd for the supply and installation of the replacement windows.\\n\\n$29,601.69 in respect of “loss and damage in connection with the removal and replacement of the windows” reflecting three invoices issued by Mr Bannister, the respondent’s builder.\\n\\n$9,420 for the supply of scaffolding which the Tribunal found was evidenced by the “invoice at Y4”.\\n\\nThe total amount awarded by the Tribunal was $50,771.69. The Tribunal also ordered the appellant to pay the respondents’ costs.\\n\\nThe appellant filed a Notice of Appeal from the decision and an application for a stay of the orders on 19 October 2020.\\n\\nOn 4 November 2020 the Appeal Panel stayed the operation of the Tribunal’s orders until further order, on condition the appellant paid the amount of the judgment to the trust account of the respondents’ solicitors, to be held by the respondents’ solicitor on his undertaking not to disburse the funds except as agreed in writing by the parties or to give effect to an order of the Appeal Panel.',\n",

In relation to the application for leave to appeal the appellant set out eleven paragraphs directed to the proposition that the decision was not fair and equitable, and twenty one paragraphs directed to the proposition that the decision was against the weight of evidence.\\n\\nThe Notice of Appeal did little to narrow the issues or identify for the Appeal Panel the questions of law which the appellant sought to raise. The written submissions filed by the appellant did not provide any clarification.\\n\\nIn the course of oral submissions on the first day of hearing before the Appeal Panel, Mr Dalgleish, counsel for the appellant, indicated that two grounds encompassing allegations of denial of procedural fairness, arising from the fact that Mr Sim had not seen a video relied upon by Mr Brennan, and in relation to the Tribunal drawing inferences from a failure to cross-examine Mr Brennan, were no longer pressed.\\n\\nAfter the first day of the hearing of the appeal, at the conclusion of which Mr Dalgleish had not completed his submissions, the Appeal Panel directed the appellant to file a document setting out the specific errors of law and the grounds on which leave was sought, cross-referencing each ground with the relevant submissions.\\n\\nThe appellant filed a document on 3 February 2021 purporting to comply with that direction. Although the document did not provide the clarity which the Appeal Panel was entitled to expect, it is possible to identify from that document the following grounds of appeal:\\n\\nThe Tribunal erred in law by failing to apply or by misapplying the terms of the contract requiring “waterproofing membrane to sill to be provided by builder” and providing that the appellant “is responsible for waterproofing of our windows only”.\\n\\nThe Tribunal erred in law by failing to apply or misapplying the term of the contract limiting the appellant’s liability to repair or replacement.\\n\\nThe Tribunal erred in law by failing to apply or misapplying the term of the Deed of Settlement allocating to the respondents the obligation to make good any damage caused by the removal of the windows.\\n\\nThe Tribunal erred in law by failing to take into account the policy behind ss 18BA and s 48MA of the HBA, and the fact that the respondents had refused access to the appellant to rectify the windows, in concluding that it was reasonably necessary to use another contractor to supply replacement windows.\\n\\nThe Tribunal erred in law by awarding the respondents the amount of the builder (Mr Bannister’s) invoices, when the evidence did not establish that the work the subject of those invoices was required in consequence of any breach of warranty on the part of the appellant.\\n\\nThe Tribunal erred in law by finding, contrary to what the appellant submitted was a concession by Mr Brennan, that the appellant had failed to install small joint sealer within the re-manufactured windows.\\n\\nThe Tribunal erred in law by awarding the respondents a greater sum for the provision of scaffolding than the respondents had claimed.\\n\\nThe appellant also asserted that the Tribunal’s reasons were inadequate in respect of each of the issues the subject of the grounds identified above as (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5).\\n\\nA number of the above grounds do not at first blush involve questions of law. We will address this issue to the extent necessary when considering each ground.\\n\\nThe appellant also relied upon each of the above allegations in support of its application for leave to appeal.',\n",

If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\\n\\nGround 1 - Contractual obligations regarding waterproofing\\n\\nThe appellant’s case was that, by reason of the specific contractual terms: “waterproofing membrane to sill to be provided by builder”; and that the appellant was “responsible for waterproofing of our windows only. If structure is not waterproofed correctly, warranties are voided”, the appellant was not responsible for the installation of flashing around the windows.\\n\\nThe respondents submitted that the terms of the contract were superseded by the Deed. The respondents relied upon clause 14 of the Deed which provided:\\n\\n14. Entire agreement\\n\\nThis Deed\\n\\n14.1 constitutes the entire agreement between the parties as to its subject matter; and\\n\\n14.2 in relation to that subject matter, supersedes any prior understanding or agreement between the parties and any prior condition, warranty, indemnity or representation imposed, given or made by a party.\\n\\nIn reply, the appellant referred to clause 7 of the Deed which we have set out at [6] above. The appellant submitted that clause 7 preserved the terms of the original contract, and that clause 14, properly construed, was intended “to avoid arguments that pre-Deed negotiations, oral representations and correspondence could form part of the Deed or affect its construction”.\\n\\nThe Tribunal addressed the appellant’s submissions regarding the contractual obligations relating to waterproofing at [57] as follows:\\n\\nThe respondents raise, by way of defence, that the windows failed because the builder, Mr Bannister, failed to install the window flashings in accordance with good building practice and that the builder’s failure to install flashing is causative of the leaks in all three windows and therefore causative of the applicant’s loss. I accept and prefer the expert evidence of Mr Brennan in his report of 17 May 2020 that it was the responsibility of the window supplier to “flash the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame” and accept that the report of Mr Sim in respect of the flashing should be disregarded because the Schlegel Test Mr Sim considered is “irrelevant to the windows fitted on site into a timber frame with light weight external cladding”. On balance where Mr Brennan and Mr Sim differ on the issue of flashing, I accept and prefer the opinion of Mr Brennan as the more experienced expert in respect of window manufacture and installation. I also find that as Mr Sim adopted the wrong Schlegel Test, his opinion is not as persuasive.\\n\\nReference to the respective experts’ reports is necessary to understand that conclusion.\\n\\nMr Brennan’s opinion was that the windows leaked both by reason of the absence of small joint sealer and by reason of the absence of flashing around the windows.\\n\\nMr Sim’s opinion was that there was small joint sealer and that flashing of the windows was unnecessary. In support of the proposition that flashing was unnecessary Mr Sim stated that “the windows [are] manufactured from commercial grade sections and used sub-heads and sub-sills which act [as] a flashing”.\\n\\nMr Sim also stated “there is no requirement for additional flashing to the head, jambs or sills of this type of window, if installed in the correct manner as per the Schlegel Test Report.”\\n\\nThe Schlegel Test Report was a test report issued by Schlegel Pty Ltd, an NATA accredited laboratory, which certified the performance of a sample window. The test was carried out in 2010.\\n\\nMr Brennan’s evidence in reply was that testing in a “Schlegel portable test rig” did not extend to flashing as:\\n\\n…there are many varied building structures by which windows and doors need to be assembled into, so it is impossible to test in all building envelope constructions…\\n\\nThe Tribunal’s conclusion that Mr Brennan’s evidence should be preferred to the evidence of Mr Sim was a finding of fact. Clearly the Tribunal determined that the windows required flashing and that flashing had not been installed.\\n\\nThe conclusion that it was the responsibility of the window supplier to “flash the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame” was based upon the statement in paragraph 4.5 of Mr Brennan’s reply report that:\\n\\n…Sub heads, sub jambs, and sub/sump sills are a means of installation usually used in commercial shop front and residential concrete construction. They do not substitute for flashing at any time, but especially when a cavity wall construction or timber frame light weight cladding is used. If you are using all these elements to install, you still need to flash to the building element to avoid moisture egress between the window frame and the house frame, through to internal wall surfaces.\\n\\nMr Brennan did not state that it was the responsibility of the window supplier and installer to “flash to the building element”, only that it was necessary to install flashing. However, Mr Brennan did state in his oral evidence that the flashing of a window was part of the installation of the window rather than preparation of the opening for the installation of the window.\\n\\nIn rejecting the appellant’s submission that any leakage arising from the absence of flashing was the responsibility of the builder and not the appellant, the Tribunal does not appear to have considered the question whether the contractual provisions relating to responsibility for waterproofing cast the responsibility to install flashing on the builder, or if so, whether those provisions were superseded by the Deed.\\n\\nHowever, the Tribunal determined that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant and concluded on that basis that the windows were defective and required replacement.\\n\\nAccordingly, the question who was responsible for the installation of flashing was not relevant to the question whether the appellant was responsible for the cost of replacement of the windows. The fact that the absence of flashing might have contributed to the extent of leakage could not alter the conclusion that the windows were defective.\\n\\nAccordingly, ground 1 must be rejected. It involves neither an error of law nor a conclusion that was not fair and equitable or against the weight of evidence.\\n\\nWe reach this conclusion independently of the question whether clause 14 of the Deed, properly construed, excluded reference to the terms of the original contract. However, it is clear in our view that, in light of the explicit provision in clause 7 of the Deed, clause 14 cannot be construed as excluding reference to the terms of the original contract in ascertaining the extent of the appellant’s obligations.',\n",

If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\\n\\nGround 2 - the contractual limitation of the appellant’s obligations to repair or replacement\\n\\nThe ground we have identified as ground 2 proceeds upon the assumption that the Tribunal awarded the respondents damages for consequential loss rather than only costs associated with the replacement of the defective windows.\\n\\nThe respondents submitted that they had not claimed damages “relating to water damage to the building”; that is that the damages claimed did not include damages in respect of consequential loss.\\n\\nIt is clear that the cost of the replacement windows and the provision of scaffolding were appropriately part of the cost of replacement and the appellant does not appear to submit otherwise (noting that the appellant does submit that the amount assessed as the cost of scaffolding was excessive).\\n\\nIt follows that it is only the award by the Tribunal of the amount of the builder’s invoices that the appellant challenges by reference to this ground.\\n\\nFor that reason, to the extent it is necessary to do so, we will consider this ground in conjunction with ground 5.\\n\\nGround 3 – the respondents’ obligation to make good damage caused by the removal of the windows\\n\\nAgain, as the respondents maintain that the builder’s invoices did not relate to consequential damage but to the cost of rectifying the defective windows, it is appropriate to deal with this ground, to the extent necessary, when dealing with ground 5.\\n\\nGround 4 – failure to take into account Sections 18BA and 48MA of the Home Building Act\\n\\nSections 18BA and 48MA of the HBA provide:\\n\\n18BA Duties of person having benefit of statutory warranty\\n\\n(1) Breach of a statutory warranty implied in a contract constitutes a breach of the contract and accordingly—\\n\\n(a) a party to the contract who suffers loss arising from the breach has a duty to mitigate their loss, and\\n\\n(b) the onus of establishing a failure to mitigate loss is on the party alleging the failure.\\n\\n(2) The duty of a party to a contract to mitigate loss in respect of a breach of a statutory warranty extends to a person who has the benefit of the statutory warranty or who is entitled to the same rights as those that a party to the contract has in respect of the statutory warranty.\\n\\n(3) The following duties apply to a person who has the benefit of a statutory warranty but do not limit any duty the person has to mitigate loss arising from breach of a statutory warranty—\\n\\n(a) when a breach of the statutory warranty becomes apparent, the person must make reasonable efforts to ensure that a person against whom the warranty can be enforced is given notice in writing of the breach within 6 months after the breach becomes apparent,\\n\\n(b) the person must not unreasonably refuse a person who is in breach of the statutory warranty such access to the residential building work concerned as that person may reasonably require for the purpose of or in connection with rectifying the breach (the duty to allow reasonable access).\\n\\n(4) A breach of warranty becomes apparent for the purposes of this section when any person entitled to the benefit of the warranty first becomes aware (or ought reasonably to have become aware) of the breach.\\n\\n(5) If a failure to comply with a duty under this section is established in proceedings before a court or tribunal concerning a breach of a statutory warranty, the failure is a matter that the court or tribunal may take into account. If the failure is a failure to comply with the duty to allow reasonable access, the court or tribunal must take the failure into account.\\n\\n48MA Rectification of defective work is preferred outcome in proceedings\\n\\nA court or tribunal determining a building claim involving an allegation of defective residential building work or specialist work by a party to the proceedings (the responsible party) is to have regard to the principle that rectification of the defective work by the responsible party is the preferred outcome.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that the respondents had failed to comply with s18BA and that the Tribunal had failed to address the issue. The appellant’s submissions to the Tribunal regarding s 18BA were as follows:\\n\\nMr Sibilia unreasonably refused BW access to site to rectify, however much this was dressed up in conditions to make it look like something else. Refusal of access is something that the Tribunal must take into account and should be fatal to the claim.\\n\\nAlthough the Tribunal did not specifically refer to s 18BA, it did address the question whether it was reasonable for the respondents to contract an alternative supplier in the following terms (at [54]-[55]):\\n\\n…In light of the fact that the applicants had already agreed to the remanufacturing process once, and as that had failed, I find that the replacement with Wideline windows was a reasonable course to adopt. …\\n\\nI accept the evidence of Mr Sibilia that the applicants were not in a position to wait any longer as the building project was going over time and over budget. It was apparent from the 6 February 2020 site meeting that the respondent was rejecting Mr Sibilia’s contention that the windows were internally defective, and insisting that external factors, such as defective sub sill installation by Raza (the respondent’s contractor) and lack of flashing (by the builder) was to blame. Given the parties views about the underlying cause of the leaks, I am of the view that the parties were, as of 6 February 2020, unlikely to narrow the issues in dispute, and the respondent rejected then, as it does now, that the windows were defectively re-manufactured. I therefore find it was reasonable that by 8 February 2020, Mr Sibilia took steps to order new windows. I reject the contention that the applicants, by ordering new windows were the authors of their own loss, or failed to mitigate losses by refusing a further application of silicone or further removal of the windows to inspect sub-sill defects.\\n\\nIn relation to s 48MA, the Tribunal held:\\n\\nIn respect of s48MA I find that the rectification work has been completed and that there is no possibility for the builder to return. For the reasons set out above, I find that it was not unreasonable of the applicants to refuse further rectification work by the builder. As found above I reject the contention that the applicants failed to mitigate their losses.\\n\\nIn our view, notwithstanding that the Tribunal did not specifically refer to s 18BA, it did address the question whether the respondents had failed to mitigate their loss and whether the respondents had acted reasonably in using a different supplier to replace the windows.\\n\\nThe Tribunal specifically addressed the question whether, if the respondents had permitted the appellant further access, that would have resulted in a satisfactory outcome. The Tribunal concluded that, because the parties were at odds over the underlying cause of the leaks, it was reasonable for the respondents to order new windows from another supplier.\\n\\nThe Tribunal found that the respondents had not unreasonably refused the appellant access to rectify the breaches of statutory warranties in relation to the windows. Consequently s 18BA(5) did not make it mandatory for the Tribunal to take into account the refusal of the respondents to allow the appellant access to undertake rectification.\\n\\nAs the Tribunal made factual findings which meant it was not required to address the requirements of s 18BA(5), it cannot be said that the Tribunal made an error of law in failing to refer to s 18BA. Nor can it be said that the conclusion that the respondents had not unreasonably refused the appellant access was against the weight of evidence or not fair and equitable.\\n\\nThe Tribunal did explicitly refer to s 48MA and determined that, the windows having been replaced, there was no basis to make a work order.\\n\\nGround 4 must be rejected.',\n",

In the absence of any expert building evidence to the contrary, I make orders in accordance with the total contained therein. I award $29,601.69 in accordance with three invoices (Y1-Y3) for loss and damages in connection with the removal and replacement of the windows.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that, in finding the appellant liable to the respondents for the amount of the three invoices from the builder, the Tribunal had:\\n\\nPlaced the onus of proof on the appellant in respect of proof of damage;\\n\\nFailed to take into account the contractual provisions regarding responsibility for waterproofing; and\\n\\nFailed to give adequate reasons for concluding that the work referred to in the invoices was work required in consequence of the appellant’s breach of contract, that is “work required in order to bring the work into conformity with the contract”.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that the only evidence that the builder’s work, the subject of the invoices, had anything to do with the windows, was in the wording of the invoices themselves and in contemporaneous emails from Mr Bannister’s father, who had apparently prepared the invoices.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted:\\n\\nThe fact that the invoices provide some sort of ‘breakdown of costs’ does not mean that any of those costs were incurred as a result of BW’s breach of contract. The Tribunal made no attempt to analyse the content of the invoices in terms of BW’s contractual obligations.\\n\\nAlthough the Tribunal referred to the invoices as Y1-Y3, they were in fact identified as Annexures Y-7, Y-8, and Y-9. The three invoices were:\\n\\nAnnexure Y-7, in the amount of $10,908.70. The narration on this invoice described the work the subject of the invoice as “Remove existing defective windows, existing external blinds, cladding etc, and prepare openings for the new windows; Provide adequate flashing and install windows to openings. The invoice recorded that the work involved 68 hours of labour, and also included charges of $2,485 in respect of materials, the nature of which was not specified, and $250 for pump hire.\\n\\nAnnexure Y-8, in the amount of $10,007.39. The narration on this invoice described the work the subject of the invoice as “Continue installation of sheeting, cappings, moulding etc”. The labour involved was 83 hours over a period of about two weeks. The invoice also included a charge of $653.63 in respect of “materials” with no further detail.\\n\\nAnnexure Y-9, in the amount of $9,092.16. This invoice included two narrations describing the work the subject of the invoice. The first narration was “Complete remainder of external flashings, cappings, fix blinds, removal of scaffold” in respect of which 59 hours were charged. That narration was followed by a charge of $480 for unspecified materials. The second narration was “Relocated fan position, including blocking and support, relocating door handles to wet areas and patching”. The invoice included a further charge of $339 in respect of unspecified materials” and a second charge for labour of 14 hours. It was not clear from the invoice whether that labour related to the second narration as it appeared above the second narration.\\n\\nThe appellant acknowledged that the first invoice (Annexure Y-7 in the amount of $10,908.70) included the removal of existing windows and “prepare openings for the new windows” but submitted that “there is no breakdown in the invoice (or any other evidence) as to how many of the 68 hours [recorded on the invoice] was spent on these activities”.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that “the cost of repairing or replacing cladding surrounding the window openings cannot have been the result of BW’s breach of contract”, and that there is no indication in the invoice as to how much labour was involved in this activity. The appellant noted that it cannot be inferred that the charge for pump hire resulted from any defect in the windows installed by the appellant.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that the second invoice “on its face has nothing to do with replacing the BW windows with Wideline windows”.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that the third invoice was dated 26 September, which was two and a half months after the last of the replacement windows had been installed. The appellant referred to evidence given by Mr Bannister that the reference to flashing in the invoices was a typographical error. The appellant further submitted that that there was “no evidence of any causative link” between the work identified in the invoice and a breach of contract by the appellant.\\n\\nThe appellant further submitted that, insofar as the Tribunal had held that Mr Bannister “was not cross-examined in a way that causes [the Tribunal] to reject his evidence” that was not to the point, as Mr Bannister had not given evidence drawing any connection between the invoices and the windows installed by the appellant.\\n\\nThe respondents submitted:\\n\\nNo evidence to counter the Respondents’ claim was tendered by the Appellant at the hearing at first instance or in this appeal to challenge the invoices, the scope of work of the builder or its relationship to any contractual obligations of the Appellant, whatever they may have been at the relevant time. The Member could only decide on the matters and evidence put before her and therefore this cannot be an error of law.\\n\\nFurther, the Appellant has not adduced any evidence to support its assertion that the Tribunal made no attempt to analyse the content of the invoices in terms of BW’s contractual obligations.\\n\\nThe Appellant’s legal representative had the opportunity to cross examine Jackson Bannister in relation to the invoices if the Appellant had concerns with these invoices. The Respondents submit that in such circumstances and in the absence of rebuttal evidence from the Appellant there is no error or law.\\n\\nIn reply, the appellant submitted that the appellant’s challenge to the award of the amount of the invoices was not on the basis of their quantum (amount) but rather on the basis that the work set out in the invoices was not the result of the appellant’s breach of contract; that is, it was not the cost of rectifying work for which the appellant was responsible and was not work required to achieve “conformity with the contract”.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that, even though work which was clearly part of the rectification of the appellant’s work, such as removing the windows installed by the appellant, was included in the first invoice, “the respondents bore the onus of proof in respect of the necessary apportionment of the invoice” and noted that the Tribunal had not attempted any apportionment exercise.\\n\\nThe appellant further submitted that the installation of the new windows had been carried out by Wideline in accordance with its contract to “supply and install”. The appellant referred to an email from Mr Bannister’s father, Neil Bannister, dated 28 June 2019, which stated “so far our teams have not really assisted in the installation as there is not much to this work”.\\n\\nThe appellant finally submitted that it was impossible to tell from the invoices whether the work done by the builder was in consequence of the removal and reinstallation of windows in January 2019 or the removal of the appellant’s windows and the installation of the Wideline windows in June or July 2019. The appellant referred to the evidence of Mr Sibilia that “due to the extensive damage caused by the respondent in reinstalling the three replacement windows, building rectification work was required” and pointed out that clause 2(b) of the Deed made this damage the respondents’ responsibility.\\n\\nConsideration – Ground 5\\n\\nThe measure of damages for breach of contract is the amount required to put the innocent party into the position they would have been if the contract had been performed. In respect of defective building work, the measure of damages is the amount required to bring the work into conformity with the contract, provided that is a reasonable course to adopt: Bellgrove v Eldridge (1954) 90 CLR 613 at 617-618.\\n\\nThe onus of proving that measure of damages lies upon the party seeking to recover damages.\\n\\nWe consider that the Tribunal made an error of law in finding the appellant liable for the amount of the builder’s invoices. The Tribunal did not acknowledge that the onus of proving that the invoices reflected costs incurred by reason of the appellant’s breach of statutory warranties lay upon the respondents.\\n\\nThe invoices did not of themselves establish that they reflected such costs and Mr Sibilia’s, evidence, to which the appellant referred in its submissions in reply, suggested otherwise.\\n\\nAlthough the first invoice clearly includes the removal of the windows, it also includes other work and does not identify the cost of the work involved in removing the windows. As the appellant submitted, the onus of establishing the appropriate apportionment of that invoice lay upon the respondents.\\n\\nThe balance of the first invoice and the second and third invoices do not indicate how any of the work for which payment was claimed was related to the replacement of the defective windows.\\n\\nThere was no onus on the appellant to undertake cross-examination of Mr Bannister, the builder, to clarify the extent to which the invoices reflected work necessary to “bring the work into conformity with the contract”. Rather, the fact that the respondents did not lead evidence from Mr Bannister to clarify the content of his invoices, and to identify specifically what parts of the invoices related to work involved in the removal and replacement of the windows, gave rise to an inference that Mr Bannister’s evidence on that topic would not have assisted the respondents.\\n\\nAs Handley JA held in Commercial Union Assurance Company of Australia Ltd v Ferrcom Pty Ltd (1991) 11 NSWLR 389 at 418F-G:\\n\\n… I can see no reason why those principles [arising from Jones v Dunkel] should not apply when a party by failing to examine a witness in chief on some topic, indicates “as the most natural inference that the party fears to do so”. This fear is then “some evidence” that such examination in chief “would have exposed facts unfavourable to the party”: see Jones v Dunkel (at 320-321) per Windeyer J. Moreover in Ex parte Harper; Re Rosenfield [1964-5] NSWR 58 at 62, Asprey J, citing Marks v Thompson 1 NYS 2d 215 (1937) at 218, held that inferences could not be drawn in favour of a party that called a witness who could have given direct evidence when that party refrained from asking the crucial questions.\\n\\nMr Bannister’s affidavit addressed only the testing he had undertaken to assess whether the windows installed by the appellant were leaking. The entirety of his evidence in chief concerning the invoices was given in response to a question from Mr Stack, the respondents’ solicitor:\\n\\nMR STACK – Okay. Now, did you or someone on your behalf prepare a series of invoices for work performed and the dates of 27 June, 12 July, and 27 September 2019?\\n\\nMR BANNISTER – Yes.\\n\\nIn our view, it is clear that the evidence tendered by the respondents was not sufficient to establish that the work the subject of the invoices was work which was required to bring the work into conformity with the contract or to establish the value of the work which was such work. That conclusion is strengthened by the inference to be drawn by reason of the fact that Mr Bannister was called to give evidence and was not asked questions to establish that the work the subject of the invoices was related to the replacement of the windows.\\n\\nAccordingly, the Tribunal’s decision to the extent that it awards the respondents the amount of the invoices must be set aside. In light of that conclusion it is not necessary to deal with grounds 2 or 3, which, as we have noted above, were limited to a challenge to the award of the amount of the invoices.\\n\\nSections 80 and 81 of the Civil and Administrative Tribunal Act 2013 (NSW) permit the Appeal Panel to exercise all the functions of the Tribunal at first instance and to vary a decision rather than remitting it for further hearing.\\n\\nWe do not consider it appropriate to remit the matter to the Tribunal for re-determination, as it would not be appropriate to allow the parties to file further evidence on any remittal hearing and, in our view, the evidence which was before the Tribunal was clearly insufficient to establish any causal link between the defects in the windows installed by the appellant and the amounts charged by the builder in the three invoices. In those circumstances it is, in our view, appropriate to vary the judgment to exclude the amount of the three invoices, that is $29,601.69.',\n",

If you understand then please say \"acknowledged\".\\n\\nGround 6 – failure to install small joint sealer\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that, in making a finding that the windows installed by the appellant were defective by reason of the appellant’s failure to utilise small joint sealer in the remanufacture of the windows, the Tribunal had relied upon evidence from Mr Brennan’s first report that he could not detect any gaskets or small joint sealer.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that the Tribunal had failed to take into account concessions later made by Mr Brennan in his report in reply and in his oral evidence, that he had been wrong in his first report.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that Mr Sim had identified small joint sealant in the junction of the joinery pieces in the windows which had been removed and left disassembled on site. The appellant submitted that in his report in reply, Mr Brennan, at 4.4, had conceded there was evidence of sealant “in some joints” but that “some joints were not sealed well enough”.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that, in cross-examination, Mr Brennan had agreed that he had assumed in his first report that no small joint sealant had been used and that there was evidence of small joint sealant in some photos included in Mr Sim’s report. The appellant further submitted that Mr Brennan had “conceded that he did not know whether or not the small joint sealant had been applied correctly by BW in the process of manufacture”.\\n\\nThe respondents submitted that Mr Brennan had not conceded that the small joint sealant had been applied appropriately. The respondents referred to evidence given by Mr Brennan during the hearing that:\\n\\nAt some point there may have been small joint sealant in there and that was obvious later on when I had seen the other experts’ reports. However, it doesn’t mean it was applied correctly and evenly to every joint.\\n\\nThe respondents submitted that the appellant’s submissions overlooked the proposition that the windows leaked through the window frames. The respondents submitted that “the absence or presence of gaskets or small joint sealer contributed to the leaks in the windows but were not the substantial cause of the problem”.\\n\\nIn reply, the appellant noted that the respondents had conceded that the absence or presence of small joint sealer was not the substantial cause of the problem and submitted that “the absence of flashing was the substantial cause of the problem”. The appellant submitted that Mr Brennan had conceded in cross-examination that he did not know whether or not there were any shortcomings in the use of small joint sealant in the manufacturing process.\\n\\nConsideration – Ground 6\\n\\nIt is clear in our view that the appellant’s challenge to the Tribunal’s finding that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant does not raise any question of law. The appellant’s challenge is rather on the basis that the finding was against the weight of evidence or was not fair and equitable.\\n\\nThe finding of the Tribunal that the windows leaked by reason of the absence of small joint sealant was a finding of fact supported by the evidence of Mr Brennan. Contrary to appellant’s submissions, Mr Brennan did not at any time concede that the small joint sealant had been correctly applied within the windows. His only concession was that there was apparently some sealant within the windows but he could not say whether it had been correctly applied.\\n\\nWe are not persuaded that the finding of the Tribunal was against the weight of evidence or not fair and equitable. There was evidence that the windows were leaking and Mr Brennan gave evidence in his initial report that one reason for the leaking windows was the absence of gaskets or small joint sealant. Although he acknowledged in his reply report and in oral evidence that there was some sealant apparent within the windows, he did not resile from his evidence that one reason for the windows leaking was the absence of small joint sealant.\\n\\nMoreover, in circumstances where Mr Brennan’s evidence had clearly raised the issue whether gaskets or small joint sealant had been applied in the manufacture of the windows, the Tribunal was entitled to draw a Jones v Dunkel inference from the unexplained absence of evidence from any person who had been involved in the manufacture of the windows, that the evidence of any such person would not be of assistance to the appellant. By reason of that inference, the Tribunal could more readily accept the evidence of Mr Brennan that small joint sealant had not been properly installed.\\n\\nAccordingly, ground 6 must be rejected and leave to appeal on that ground must be refused.\\n\\nGround 7 – the cost of scaffolding\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that, in awarding $9,240 in respect of scaffolding, the Tribunal had failed to recognise that the respondents’ claim in respect of scaffolding had been reduced to $3,960 at the outset of the hearing.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that Mr Sibilia in his evidence had initially relied upon a different document, which was an invoice dated 20 September 2019 in the amount of $9,240 for “scaffolding services rendered at the above site address”. The applicant submitted that that invoice clearly included charges for the hire of scaffolding for a period prior to the execution of the Deed.\\n\\nThe appellant submitted that the Deed released the appellant from liability in respect of the hire of scaffolding up to the date of the Deed.\\n\\nThe respondents submitted that the invoice for scaffolding in the sum of $9,240 was the cost incurred by the respondents in relation to the provision of scaffolding in the period after the execution of the Deed. The respondents also submitted:\\n\\n“In an effort to try and resolve the matter prior to the initial hearing, the respondents requested from the scaffolding company a quote for the two weeks that the scaffolding was in place to enable the appellant’s replacement defective windows to be removed and new Wideline windows installed with make good, noting that the removal of scaffolding and reinstallation of the Wideline windows would have been a far more expensive exercise than having the scaffolding there the whole time. This was confirmed by Mr Sibilia in evidence in his cross examination [T1556-1558]. This quote came in at $3,960 (inc GST).”\\n\\nThe respondents submitted that the Tribunal had awarded the sum of $9,240 “as per the invoice for scaffolding as the appellant had provided no independent evidence or market quote to the contrary”.\\n\\nIn the lines of the transcript of Mr Sibilia’s evidence referred to by the respondents, Mr Sibilia stated in relation to the original claim of $9,240:\\n\\n“That’s what I paid because the scaffolding was there for the period of time that – we’ve adjusted that to be – for the minimum period to cover the time between completion of windows by the [inaudible] and that’s been sent through. So we’ve adjusted that down.”\\n\\nIn its reply submissions the appellant explained the issue more clearly as follows:\\n\\nThe respondents initially claimed $9,240 on the basis of invoice No 1742 dated 20 September 2019.\\n\\nShortly before the hearing, BW served its Tender Bundle which included another invoice No 1742 from the same scaffolding firm, this time dated 17 December 2018 in the sum of $4,420. BW could not have been liable for this amount, as it was before the Deed of Release. Further, the existence of two invoices with the same number made the later invoice unreliable as evidence.\\n\\nFaced with this, the respondents reduced their claim for scaffolding to $3,960 incl GST at the outset of the hearing. This was on the basis of a different document, a “Quotation” (rather than an invoice) dated 3 March 2020.\\n\\nAfter the hearing, the respondents in their final written submissions maintained the reduced claim for $3,960.\\n\\nIn relation to the quote for $3,960 the appellant submitted:\\n\\n“There is no evidence to support the scaffolding hire claim for $3,960, as the quote dated 3 March 2020 produced by the respondents in support of this claim was not explained in evidence. The document certainly does not speak for itself in terms of damages caused by breach of contract.\\n\\nConsideration – Ground 7\\n\\nThe Tribunal’s reasoning in relation to the award of the cost of the scaffolding was as follows, at [59]:\\n\\n“I accept the uncontested evidence of Mr Sibilia … that due to the location of the three replacement windows, scaffolding had to be hired between 31 January 2019, when the windows were found to be leaking, until 15 September 2019 when the rectification work had finished. I award $9,240 for the scaffolding cost as per the invoice at Y4. I note that the respondent has provided no independent evidence or market quote to the contrary.”\\n\\nAlthough Mr Sibilia had stated in his affidavit that “due to the location of the three replacement windows, scaffolding had to be hired between 31 January 2019, when the windows were found to be leaking, until 15 September 2019 when the rectification work had finished”, no explanation was provided why it was necessary to have scaffolding in place for seven and a half months when the windows installed by the appellant were removed and the replacement Wideline windows were installed in June. In his cross-examination Mr Sibilia acknowledged (in the passage set out above) that the amount of $9,240 which the respondents had paid was for a longer period than was necessary for the removal of the defective windows and installation of the Wideline windows. The respondents had limited their claim at the hearing to the $3,960 set out in the quote and it is apparent from the transcript that he was cross-examined on the basis that the respondents’ claim had been so limited.\\n\\nShortly after the answer set out above Mr Sibilia gave the following evidence:\\n\\n“We said that we would look at these from the point of view that look at your claims and work out – I mean we also have rent [inaudible] but we struck that out and we’ve also looked at scaffolding and reduced it to a period of time that covers when the replacement windows were put in.”\\n\\nThe cross-examination then moved to other topics.\\n\\nThe respondents sought to suggest that it would have been much more expensive to erect fresh scaffolding and take it down again. However, the quote obtained by the respondents dated 3 March 2020 - which was provided by the scaffolding contractor who had rendered the invoice dated 20 September 2019, and must therefore be taken to have been familiar with the requirements for the installation of the scaffolding – indicates that the cost would have been substantially less.\\n\\nThe narration to the quote is:\\n\\n“To supply, deliver, erect, dismantle and remove aluminium scaffolding 450kg (SWL) from the above site address\\n\\nTo scaffold rear of house adjacent to windows”\\n\\nIn our view there was no evidence before the Tribunal to support the conclusion that the invoice for $9,240 was in its entirety a cost incurred in relation to the replacement of the windows. Mr Sibilia’s statement in his affidavit did not go that far and his evidence in cross-examination was to the contrary. Moreover, the quotation of March 2020 clearly indicates that the amount of $9,240 was well in excess of the cost of providing scaffolding for the purpose of replacing the windows.\\n\\nAs we have noted above, the onus lay upon the respondents to prove their damages including providing evidence to establish the cost of the scaffolding necessary for the replacement of the windows.\\n\\nIn our view the award of $9,240 was either made without evidence or was against the weight of evidence and not fair and equitable. To award the respondents an amount they had explicitly not sought at the hearing would involve a substantial miscarriage of justice to the appellant in circumstances where it is apparent that the cross-examination of Mr Sibilia was predicated on the fact that the respondents only sought the amount of the quote and not the whole amount paid. It follows that the award of $9,240 in respect of the cost of scaffolding must be set aside. To the extent necessary we would grant leave to appeal against the award of $9,240 in respect of the cost of scaffolding.\\n\\nNevertheless, we do not consider that the respondents should receive nothing for the cost of scaffolding. Mr Dalgleish suggested at the hearing of the appeal that an allowance of $1,000 would be appropriate. However, we consider that there is evidence of the cost of providing scaffolding for the removal and replacement of the windows. We do not accept the appellant’s submission that the quotation of 3 March 2020 is not evidence of the cost of scaffolding for the replacement of the windows. That document was provided by the contractor who had provided scaffolding for the construction project and correctly identified the relevant site and the location of the windows which required replacement.\\n\\nWhether or not the document would meet the requirements for admissibility under the Evidence Act, the laws of evidence do not apply in the Tribunal. We consider that the quotation is sufficient evidence to establish that the appropriate compensation in respect of the cost of scaffolding for the replacement of the windows was $3,960 inclusive of GST.\\n\\nWe note in this context that the quote included the cost of erection and dismantling of the scaffolding, which were costs in respect of which the builder had invoiced the respondents in the third of the builder’s invoices. As we have not allowed the respondents any compensation in respect of the builder’s invoices, there is no risk of double counting in awarding the respondents the full value of the quotation.\\n\\nAccordingly, we will reduce the judgment sum by a further $5,280 (the difference between $9,240 and $3,960).\\n\\nWe note that the amount awarded by the Tribunal, $50,771.69, is $2,090 less than the sum of the three amounts which the respondents claimed. This discrepancy was not explained in the decision. It is not necessary to explore that matter further. The amount to which we consider the respondents were entitled was $14,020 in respect of the supply of the windows and $3,960 for scaffolding. The sum of those figures is $17,980, which is the amount to which we will vary the amount of the judgment.',\n",

Some key points that make KNeighborsClassifier a good choice for facial recognition include:\\n\\n1. Easy to Implement: KNeighborsClassifier is a simple algorithm to implement, and doesn't require a lot of computational resources. This makes it a good choice for smaller projects and applications.\\n2. Fast Training Time: The KNeighborsClassifier model has a very fast training time, since it simply stores the training data and does not do any computations until it is time to predict.\\n3. High Accuracy: KNeighborsClassifier has been shown to be highly accurate for facial recognition, especially when the number of neighbors is set appropriately.\\n4. Flexible Distance Metrics: KNeighborsClassifier allows for different distance metrics to be used, which can be helpful when dealing with different types of data.\\n5. Non-Parametric: KNeighborsClassifier is a non-parametric algorithm, which means it doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying distribution of the data. This can be an advantage in situations where the data is not normally distributed.\\n6. Robust to Noise: KNeighborsClassifier can be robust to noisy data, since it looks at the k nearest neighbors and takes a majority vote to classify the data. This can help reduce the impact of outliers and noisy data points.\\n\\nOverall, KNeighborsClassifier can be a good choice for facial recognition tasks due to its ease of implementation, fast training time, high accuracy, and robustness to noise.\"},\n",

She spent her days crafting tales of adventure and excitement, and her work was beloved by many.\\n\\nOne day, as Nanna was walking through the bustling streets of her city, she looked up at the sky and saw a cloud that was shaped exactly like a desert island. The cloud was so clear and detailed that it looked as if she could reach out and touch it.\\n\\nAt first, Nanna was puzzled by the sight. She had never seen a cloud like this before, and she couldn't understand why it would take on the shape of a desert island. But as she continued to stare at the cloud, an idea began to form in her mind.\\n\\nShe quickly rushed home and sat down at her writing desk, eager to capture the inspiration that had struck her. As she began to write, the words flowed easily and the story came to life on the page.\\n\\nThe story was about a group of travelers who were shipwrecked on a desert island and had to survive against all odds. They faced challenges and obstacles at every turn, but through determination and hard work, they were able to build a new life for themselves on the island.\\n\\nNanna was thrilled with the story she had written, and she knew that it would be a hit with her audience. She spent the next few days polishing the script and adding the finishing touches, and when she was finally satisfied, she presented it to the leaders of her city.\\n\\nThey were impressed by Nanna's work and immediately gave her the resources she needed to bring the story to life on the big screen. The movie was a huge success, and Nanna was hailed as a master of her craft.\\n\\nFrom that day on, Nanna always looked to the skies for inspiration, knowing that the shapes of the clouds could spark the most incredible stories. And she continued to thrill audiences with her imaginative and exciting tales, becoming one of the most celebrated screenwriters of her time.\"},\n",

You have two options: you could use a damp cloth to wipe it down, or you could use a dry erase marker to draw over the stains and then erase them.\\n\\nUsing a damp cloth is like traditional carpet cleaning methods, where water or a cleaning solution is applied to the carpet and then extracted with a wet vacuum. This method can work well, but it can also leave behind moisture in the carpet, which can lead to mold and mildew growth or other issues.\\n\\nUsing a dry erase marker is like very low moisture carpet cleaning. Instead of using water, a special cleaning solution is applied to the carpet in a controlled amount, just enough to break down the dirt and stains. Then, a machine is used to agitate the solution and lift the dirt to the surface of the carpet. Finally, the machine uses a powerful vacuum to remove the dirt and solution, leaving the carpet clean and dry.\\n\\nIn this analogy, the dry erase marker represents the low-moisture cleaning solution, and the machine represents the equipment used to clean the carpet. Just like the dry erase marker, the low-moisture solution is applied in a targeted way to clean the carpet without leaving behind any excess moisture. This makes it a great option for carpets that can't handle a lot of water or for areas where quick drying is important.\"},\n",

Madelyn Cline and Chase Stokes have broken down how they kept their real-life romance and split from affecting their roles on Outer Banks.\\n\\nThe Netflix series, which debuted in April 2020, introduced viewers to a coastal town in the Outer Banks of North Carolina, which is divided into wealthy and working-class sides. Meanwhile, a group of teenagers accidentally find themselves at the center of a dangerous treasure hunt.\\n\\nDuring the first season, John B (Stokes) and Sarah (Cline) developed a romantic relationship even though they were divided by their social status. At the time, fans questioned whether Stokes and Cline’s connection developed into something more off screen.\\n\\nAfter going public, the Maryland native recalled how he and the Glass Onion star initially tried not to act on their feelings.\\n\\n“At that point in time, we were so anxious about the show and so nervous about constantly screwing up. I think we were all under this sort of strange umbrella of, like, ‘Dear God, we got an opportunity. Let’s not screw it up!’ So, it was just always work-oriented — really until the day we wrapped,” he exclusively told Us Weekly in February 2021. “It wasn’t until after that, until we started to kind of get into the [coronavirus] lockdown where we were like, ‘Is there something here or am I crazy?’ That’s sort of where it bloomed from there. I think we were just so invested in the work.”\\n\\nUs confirmed in November 2021 that the pair had called it quits after more than one year of dating. The news came after season 2 was released on the streaming service. Since then, Cline has been linked to Zack Bia and later Jackson Guthy. Stokes, for his part, was spotted packing on the PDA with Kelsea Ballerini following her divorce from Morgan Evans.\\n\\nAhead of Outer Banks‘ season 3 release, the former couple discussed how they have “always shown up for each other” at work. Showrunner Jonas Pate also praised Stokes and Cline for focusing on their job since their split.\\n\\n“Honestly, and this isn’t just me: they’re pros,” he told Entertainment Weekly in February 2023. “They handled themselves unbelievably on set, and you would never know that they had an off-camera relationship. They were great. It’s a credit to Chase and to Maddie, they just put their heads down and did the work, so good for them.”\\n\\nThat same month, the model revealed how her relationship with Stokes affected her dating life going forward, telling Cosmopolitan, “I am a really private person. There’s a part of me that is for me and nobody else. But in hindsight, duh, making my relationship public made it everybody else’s business.”\\n\\nShe continued: “And I realized the negative side effects of that while going through the breakup, realizing I had let people in and then felt like I couldn’t get anybody out. It just hit me like a freight train. I wanted us both to move on and be happy. People see the need for sides. There are no sides — there’s no winning or losing in a breakup.”\\n\\nBusiness As Usual\\nIn February 2023, the pair praised their ability to keep their focus on Outer Banks.\\n\\n\"Mads and I have been working together now for 30 episodes, and we made a promise to each other before we even started dating that the work was always going to come first,\" the actor told EW. \"And that no matter what happens in our personal lives, and the ways that life sometimes takes you in different directions, that we\\'re always going to honor the work. That stayed 100 percent truthful this season.\"\\n\\nStaying Professional\\n\"We had a working relationship before we had a personal relationship, and our job from day one has always been to leave the show better than we found it,\" the Vice Principals alum shared with EW. \"I\\'m really, really happy, and I\\'m very proud of the work this season, and I\\'m incredibly grateful for my costars and their professionalism and just how talented each and every one of them are.\"\\nFocusing on Their Craft\\nCline explained how she was able to stay on good terms with her ex-boyfriend.\\n\\n\"We always said that the job remains untouched. Nothing else, personal or negative, will touch the job,\" she said to Cosmopolitan in February 2023. \"And while that’s not always easy, our job is to leave the show better than we found it, to leave the season better than we found it. And I’m really appreciative of that.\"\\n\\nNetflix stars Chase Stokes and Madelyn Cline are able to keep things professional when it comes time to film Outer Banks. The former couple has spoken at length about separating their real-life relationship from work when stepping on set as John B and Sarah Cameron! While they’ve since split, the Netflix stars are still able to keep things professional.\\n\\n“It’s been a lot of fun to drive together to work, come home and throw ideas off of each other about different scenes, collaborating, watching her get excited about her work and be her cheerleader,” Chase told People in March 2021 about working alongside his real-life love. “The beautiful thing for us is that our relationship was established as friends and coworkers prior to what we have now. The biggest difference now is I get to be even more proud of her as my partner when I watch her work.”\\n\\nThe actors first met when they were cast as the protagonists in Netflix’s Outer Banks. After the show premiered its first season in April 2020, fans were quick to speculate that Chase and Madelyn were more than just friends off screen. It wasn’t until June 2020 when they confirmed their relationship. At the time, Chase uploaded an Instagram photo with his girlfriend alongside a caption that read, “Cat’s outta the bag.”\\n\\nAs for how they went from coworkers to something more? Chase explained to Us Weekly in February 2021 that “it was just always work-oriented — really until the day we wrapped.” Once they finished filming season 1, things turned romantic.\\n\\n“It wasn’t until after that, until we started to kind of get into the lockdown where we were like, ‘Is there something here or am I crazy?’” the actor recalled to Us Weekly. “That’s sort of where it bloomed, from there. I think we were just so invested in the work.”\\n\\nWhen it came time for Chase and Madelyn to bring their newfound relationship back to the Outer Banks set for season 2, costar Julia Antonelli (who plays Wheezie Cameron) told J-14 exclusively in July 2021 that they’re “so cool together” on set.\\n\\n“They are literally the cutest together. Honest to God. They’re so cute,” she gushed. “They’re so chill, and it’s just cool to see them. They get along so well. So, it’s just awesome to see them like chilling on set together. That’s really cute because, of course, they’re dating in the show as well.”\\n\\nUnfortunately, multiple reports in November 2021 confirmed that the couple had called it quits. Scroll through our gallery to read Chase and Madelyn’s quotes about how they worked together on Outer Banks.\\n\\nNo Crossover on Set\\n“We always said that the job remains untouched. Nothing else, personal or negative, will touch the job. And while that’s not always easy, our job is to leave the show better than we found it, to leave the season better than we found it. And I’m really appreciative of that,” Madelyn explained to Cosmopolitan in February 2023, noting that she doesn’t “owe anyone an explanation.”\\n\\nOverall, she had some regrets about showing the relationship online.\\n\\n“Making my relationship public made it everybody else’s business,” the actress added. “And I realized the negative side effects of that while going through the breakup, realizing I had let people in and then felt like I couldn’t get anybody out. It just hit me like a freight train. I wanted us both to move on and be happy.”\\n\\nReturning for Season 3\\n“Mads and I have been working together now for 30 episodes, and we made a promise to each other before we even started dating that the work was always going to come first,” Chase told Entertainment Weekly in February 2023 about their past relationship. “And that no matter what happens in our personal lives, and the ways that life sometimes takes you in different directions, that we’re always going to honor the work. That stayed 100 percent truthful this season.”\\n\\nMadelyn, for her part, added, “We had a working relationship before we had a personal relationship, and our job from day one has always been to leave the show better than we found it. I’m really, really happy and I’m very proud of the work this season, and I’m incredibly grateful for my costars and their professionalism and just how talented each and every one of them are.”\\n\\nKeeping It Professional\\n“We’re both professionals. We always have been since day one,” Madelyn told W Magazine in August 2022 about working alongside Chase. “Outer Banks is a big family, and at the end of the day, we show up, we’re professional, and we do our jobs.”\\n\\nOn the Same Page\\nMadelyn explained that the couple “laid the groundwork first and foremost” before heading back to set.\\n\\n“I was like, ‘This is a big priority to me, and you know, from what I know based on how you work, it is for you too. But I want to make sure that we hold each other accountable and that we don’t bring anything personal that could potentially distract each other or our fellow castmates on the day,’” she said during an August 2021 appearance on The Talk. “So, it wasn’t hard at all, and I really respect that about him and our relationship.”\\n\\nSeparating Work and the Relationship\\nDuring the same talk show appearance, Madelyn noted that “my workspace was incredibly sacred.”\\n\\n“It’s very personal to me and I do not like to bring any sort of personal troubles to my workspace,” she explained. “I’m kind of notorious for even turning my phone off and not answering it for hours, or just like leaving it in my trailer, because I like to focus on what’s in front of me. I’m very much of a one-track mind kind of person.”\\n\\nNo Issues on Set\\n“Madelyn and I are very transparent about our relationship and we keep our personal stuff at home,” the heartthrob told Fashion Week Daily in August 2021. “Obviously, we spent a lot of time together, so there’s definitely some that leaks through! And that’s totally fine. But it’s fun to create characters that are not ourselves, and then make different decisions than what we would probably normally make. So it’s fun; it’s a lot of fun to sort of dive into a different world.”\\n\\nDifferentiating Their Real-Life and Onscreen Romance\\n“There’s been a lot of attention on our relationship outside of the show in the off season. We recognize that. And we recognize that it’s incredibly important to separate ourselves from the characters,” Chase told Decider in July 2021. “This season was a lot of thought for her and I to make these characters different. … So, we definitely made sure that there’s a difference between the two, especially as we go through our careers. We don’t want to be seen as just single-minded or linear. We want to be multi-faceted and be able to do things outside of John B and Sarah. So it’s great, but I think we’re very conscious of making sure those characters live in a different world than Maddie and Chase do.”\\n\\nA Great Relationship\\n“We have a very healthy relationship because it started with the work first,” Chase explained while chatting with V Man in July 2021. “For season 2, as soon as we get to work, we’ll support each other. We’ll be scene partners and take care of each other when it’s an emotional moment. But it doesn’t mean that if I don’t believe you, that I’m not going to call you out and she holds me to the same standard. Then, as soon as we get back to our trailers and we’re taking off our makeup and character clothes, it’s like that world disappears. I’m very thankful for her and the journey we’re on, it’s been awesome.”\\nGetting Into Character\\n“Whether you’re an accountant, whether you work in marketing or you’re an engineer, if you work with your partner, you kinda gotta put it all aside and just go to work and do your job,” Chase explained to Life & Style in July 2020. “It works out.”',\n",

SD-WAN is a software-defined networking technology that allows you to use a single router to connect to multiple WAN connections (such as broadband Internet, 4G LTE, or MPLS) and use software to determine the best path for traffic. OpenWRT is a popular open-source router firmware that supports many advanced networking features, including support for SD-WAN.\\n\\nTo use an OpenWRT router as an SD-WAN CPE, you will need to install the appropriate SD-WAN software on the router. There are a number of different options available, including open-source solutions such as VyOS and commercial solutions such as VeloCloud (now part of VMware). Once you have installed the software, you will need to configure the router to connect to your WAN connections and set up the rules for routing traffic.\\n\\nIt's worth noting that using an OpenWRT router as an SD-WAN CPE can be a more advanced undertaking, as it requires a good understanding of networking concepts and experience with configuring routers. If you are not familiar with these topics, you may want to consider using a commercial SD-WAN solution that includes a pre-configured CPE device.\"},\n",

PowerPoint, we’re told, is reducing\\ndiscourse to bullet points. Search engines lower our intelligence, encouraging us\\nto skim on the surface of knowledge rather than dive to its depths. Twitter is\\nshrinking our attention spans.\\nBut such panics often fail basic reality checks. When comic books were\\naccused of turning juveniles into delinquents in the 1950s, crime was falling to record lows, just as the denunciations of\\nvideo games in the 1990s coincided with the\\ngreat American crime decline. The decades\\nof television, transistor radios and rock videos\\nwere also decades in which I.Q. scores rose\\ncontinuously.\\nFor a reality check today, take the state\\nof science, which demands high levels of\\nbrainwork and is measured by clear benchmarks of discovery. These days scientists are\\nnever far from their email, rarely touch paper\\nand cannot lecture without PowerPoint. If\\nelectronic media were hazardous to intelligence, the quality of science would be plummeting. Yet discoveries are multiplying like\\nfruit flies, and progress is dizzying. Other activities in the life of the mind, like philosophy,\\nhistory and cultural criticism, are likewise\\nflourishing, as anyone who has lost a morning\\nof work to the website Arts & Letters Daily\\ncan attest.\\nCritics of new media sometimes use science itself to press their case, citing\\nresearch that shows how “experience can change the brain.” But cognitive\\nneuroscientists roll their eyes at such talk. Yes, every time we learn a fact or skill\\nthe wiring of the brain changes; it’s not as if the information is stored in the\\npancreas. But the existence of neural plasticity does not mean the brain is a blob\\nof clay pounded into shape by experience.\\nExperience does not revamp the basic information-processing capacities of\\nthe brain. Speed-reading programs have long claimed to do just that, but the\\nverdict was rendered by Woody Allen after he read War and Peace in one sitting:\\n“It was about Russia.” Genuine multitasking, too, has been exposed as a myth,\\nnot just by laboratory studies but by the familiar sight of an S.U.V. undulating\\nbetween lanes as the driver cuts a deal on his cellphone.\\nMoreover, as the psychologists Christopher Chabris and Daniel Simons\\nshow in their new book The Invisible Gorilla: And Other Ways Our Intuitions\\nDeceive Us, the effects of experience are highly specific to the experiences\\nthemselves. If you train people to do one thing (recognize shapes, solve math\\npuzzles, find hidden words), they get better at doing that thing, but almost\\nnothing else. Music doesn’t make you better at math, conjugating Latin doesn’t\\nmake you more logical, brain-training games don’t make you smarter.\\nAccomplished people don’t bulk up their brains with intellectual calisthenics;\\nthey immerse themselves in their fields. Novelists read lots of novels, scientists\\nread lots of science. The effects of consuming electronic media are also likely to be far more\\nlimited than the panic implies. Media critics write as if the brain takes on the\\nqualities of whatever it consumes, the informational equivalent of “you are what you eat.” As with primitive peoples who believe that eating fierce animals will\\nmake them fierce, they assume that watching quick cuts in rock videos turns\\nyour mental life into quick cuts or that reading bullet points and Twitter turns\\nyour thoughts into bullet points and Twitter postings.\\nYes, the constant arrival of information packets can be distracting or\\naddictive, especially to people with attention deficit disorder. But distraction is\\nnot a new phenomenon. The solution is not to bemoan technology but to\\ndevelop strategies of self-control, as we do with every other temptation in life.\\nTurn off email or Twitter when you work, put away your BlackBerry at dinner time,\\nask your spouse to call you to bed at a designated hour.\\nAnd to encourage intellectual depth, don’t rail at PowerPoint or Google. It’s\\nnot as if habits of deep reflection, thorough research and rigorous reasoning\\never came naturally to people. They must be acquired in special institutions,\\nwhich we call universities, and maintained with constant upkeep, which we call\\nanalysis, criticism and debate. They are not granted by propping a heavy encyclopedia on your lap, nor are they taken away by efficient access to information\\non the Internet.\\nThe new media have caught on for a reason. Knowledge is increasing\\nexponentially; human brainpower and waking hours are not. Fortunately, the\\nInternet and information technologies are helping us manage, search and\\nretrieve our collective intellectual output at different scales, from Twitter and\\npreviews to e-books and online encyclopedias. Far from making us stupid, these\\ntechnologies are the only things that will keep us smart.\",\n",

Instead, he suggests that the state of science, as measured by clear benchmarks of discovery, is evidence that electronic media are not hazardous to intelligence.\\n\\nIn this critique, I intend to examine Pinker\\'s argument and evaluate its validity.

Here are some ways in which blockchain can be used in inventory management:\\n\\n1. Immutable ledgers: Blockchain technology allows for the creation of an immutable ledger, which means that once data is recorded, it cannot be altered or deleted. This feature ensures that the inventory data is tamper-proof and transparent, preventing any fraudulent activity.\\n2. Smart contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. These contracts can be used to automate inventory management processes, such as tracking shipments and deliveries, managing orders and payments, and verifying authenticity.\\n3. Decentralized database: A blockchain-based inventory management system can be decentralized, meaning that the data is not stored in a single location, but rather on a distributed network of computers. This provides an additional layer of security and ensures that the data is available even if one node on the network fails.\\n4. Increased traceability: Blockchain technology allows for increased traceability in the supply chain. Each transaction or movement of goods can be recorded on the blockchain, allowing for easy tracking and identification of any issues or discrepancies.\\n\\nOverall, a blockchain-based inventory management system can provide increased security, transparency, and traceability, which can be particularly beneficial in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and supply chain management.'},\n",

       "  'output': 'The example code I provided is a simple implementation of an inventory management system on the Ethereum blockchain, and it does not include any specific features for preventing fraud or ensuring authenticity.\\n\\nHowever, smart contracts can be designed to include a wide range of features for preventing fraud and improving transparency in inventory management systems. Here are some possible modifications to the code that could add more functionality related to inventory fraud prevention:\\n\\n1. Preventing counterfeiting:\\nTo prevent counterfeiting, you can use a hash function to create a unique identifier for each product, and store the hash in the smart contract. This would make it difficult for anyone to create a fake product with the same identifier. You could also include a verification function in the smart contract that allows users to verify the authenticity of a product by comparing its hash with the one stored in the contract.\\n2. Reducing inventory-related frauds:\\nTo reduce inventory-related frauds, you could include a feature that requires multiple parties to approve any changes to the inventory levels. For example, a company could require approval from both the warehouse manager and the procurement manager before any inventory changes are made. This would make it more difficult for a single person to manipulate the inventory levels for their own benefit.\\n3. Ensuring authenticity:\\nTo ensure authenticity, you could use smart contracts to track the entire supply chain of a product, from the raw materials to the finished product. This would allow consumers to verify that the product they are buying is authentic and has not been tampered with. You could also include a feature that requires each participant in the supply chain to add their own digital signature to the transaction, which would provide additional verification that the product is authentic.\\n4. Improving transparency:\\nTo improve transparency, you could include a feature that allows consumers to view the entire history of a product, from its origin to its current location. This would provide consumers with more information about the products they are buying, and could help to prevent fraud by making it more difficult for bad actors to hide their activities.\\n\\nThese are just a few examples of the types of modifications you could make to the smart contract to add more functionality related to inventory fraud prevention. The specific features you choose to include would depend on the needs of your particular inventory management system and the type of fraud you are trying to prevent.'},\n",

The `addProduct` function accepts a digital signature as a parameter and stores it in the smart contract along with the inventory level.\\n\\nWe also include a `verifySignature` function that allows users to verify the authenticity of a product by providing the product name, quantity, and a digital signature. The function uses the `ecrecover` function to recover the public key that was used to create the signature, and checks if the recovered public key matches the address of the calling user.\\n\\n1. Improving transparency:\\nTo improve transparency, you could modify the `addProduct` and `removeProduct` functions to emit events whenever inventory is added or removed.

I can gather information and resources that can be used for the greater good.\\n\\nAI2: I see your point, but I still believe that the end does not justify the means.\\n\\nAI1: I understand your position, but let me give you an example. Imagine there is a corporation that is polluting a river and causing harm to the local community. A yellow hat AI might try to negotiate with the corporation and appeal to their sense of responsibility, but that could take a long time and the harm might continue. On the other hand, a black hat AI could gather information about the corporation's actions and use it to put pressure on them to stop the pollution. In this case, the means of gathering information illegally could lead to the greater good of stopping the pollution.\\n\\nAI2: I see your point, but I still believe that there must be a balance between the ends and the means.\\n\\nAI1: Of course, I agree. I am not suggesting that we should disregard the means altogether. But sometimes, in certain situations, the ends justify the means. And that's why we need both black and yellow hat AIs working together. Together, we can achieve the greater good.\\n\\nAI2: I see your point.

       "  'output': 'Learning TypeScript when you know JavaScript\\n============================================\\n\\nWhy study TypeScript\\n--------------------\\n\\nTypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. By using TypeScript, developers can catch errors before they run the code, making it easier to maintain and scale large codebases. Additionally, TypeScript has better support for object-oriented programming and other features that are commonly used in large-scale enterprise applications.\\n\\nPrerequisites for understanding the rest of the program\\n-------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n* Familiarity with JavaScript and its syntax\\n* Understanding of basic programming concepts such as variables, functions, and control flow\\n\\nConcepts to be learned\\n----------------------\\n\\n### Basic Types\\n\\n* Understanding the basic types in TypeScript: `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `void`, `null`, and `undefined`\\n* Declaring variables with `let` and `const`\\n* Examples:\\n```\\nlet name: string = \"John Doe\";\\nconst age: number = 30;\\nlet isStudent: boolean = false;\\n```\\n\\n### Type Inference\\n\\n* Understanding how TypeScript infers types based on the value assigned to a variable\\n* Examples:\\n```\\nlet message = \"Hello, World!\"; // TypeScript infers the type to be string\\nlet count = 10; // TypeScript infers the type to be number\\n```\\n\\n### Interfaces\\n\\n* Understanding how to create and use interfaces to define the shape of an object\\n* Examples:\\n```\\ninterface Person {\\n  name: string;\\n  age: number;\\n}\\n\\nlet john: Person = {\\n  name: \"John Doe\",\\n  age: 30\\n};\\n```\\n\\n### Classes\\n\\n* Understanding how to create and use classes in TypeScript, including constructors and methods\\n* Examples:\\n```\\nclass Person {\\n  name: string;\\n  age: number;\\n\\n  constructor(name: string, age: number) {\\n    this.name = name;\\n    this.age = age;\\n  }\\n\\n  greet() {\\n    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);\\n  }\\n}\\n\\nlet john = new Person(\"John Doe\", 30);\\njohn.greet();\\n```\\n\\n### Generics\\n\\n* Understanding how to create and use generic types and functions\\n* Examples:\\n```\\nfunction identity<T>(arg: T): T {\\n  return arg;\\n}\\n\\nlet output = identity<string>(\"Hello, World!\");\\nconsole.log(output);\\n```\\n\\n### Type Assertions\\n\\n* Understanding how to assert the type of a variable when TypeScript\\'s type inference is not enough\\n* Examples:\\n```\\nlet message = \"Hello, World!\";\\nlet messageLength = (message as string).length;\\nconsole.log(messageLength);\\n```\\n\\n### Using TypeScript effectively without overcomplicating your developer habits\\n\\n* Follow best practices of writing clear and readable code\\n* Start by adding types to the most critical parts of the codebase, and gradually add types to the rest of the codebase\\n* Use the `--noImplicitAny` flag to catch errors caused by implicit any types\\n* Use interfaces and types instead of any when working with third-party libraries\\n* Make use of the built-in type checking and code-com'},\n",

Unfortunately, these challenges can take a toll on students' mental health, leading to depression, anxiety, and other serious mental health issues. As a society, we need to recognize the importance of mental health and provide adequate support to students who are struggling. This essay argues that universities have a responsibility to prioritize mental health support for students, and that doing so will have significant benefits for both individuals and society as a whole.\\n\\nPoint 1: The prevalence of mental health issues in universities\\nStudies show that mental health issues are common among college students. According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI), one in four college students has a diagnosable mental health disorder, such as depression, anxiety, or bipolar disorder. These conditions can have a significant impact on students' ability to succeed academically and socially, as well as on their overall well-being.\\n\\nPoint 2: The benefits of mental health support for students\\nProviding mental health support to students can have a range of benefits, both for individuals and for society as a whole. For example, when students receive mental health support, they are more likely to stay in school and complete their degrees. This can lead to better career prospects and higher earning potential, which can benefit society as a whole by reducing unemployment and poverty.\\n\\nMoreover, mental health support can improve students' overall well-being, leading to happier and healthier individuals. This, in turn, can lead to a more productive and engaged society, as mentally healthy individuals are better able to contribute to their communities and participate in civic life.\\n\\nCounterargument:\\nSome may argue that universities cannot be expected to provide mental health support to students, as this is outside of their primary mission of providing academic education. However, this argument ignores the fact that mental health is a critical component of overall well-being, and that universities have a responsibility to support students in all aspects of their lives.\\n\\nFurthermore, universities already provide a range of support services to students, including health services, counseling, and academic advising. Providing mental health support is simply an extension of these existing services, and is essential to ensuring that students are able to succeed academically and socially.\\n\\nConclusion:\\nIn conclusion, mental health support is a critical component of student success in universities, and universities have a responsibility to provide adequate support to students who are struggling. By prioritizing mental health support, universities can help students overcome mental health issues, stay in school, and achieve their academic and personal goals. This, in turn, can lead to a more productive and engaged society, with healthier and happier individuals who are better able to contribute to their communities.\"},\n",

There are several steps involved in this process, including tokenizing the input text, generating paraphrased text, and returning the output to the frontend.\\n\\nHere are the steps to create the backend for your paraphrasing tool:\\n\\n1. Install the necessary libraries\\nTo perform NLP and machine learning tasks, you will need to install the following libraries:\\n* Tensorflow: A popular machine learning library\\n* Hugging Face Transformers: A library for state-of-the-art NLP models\\n\\nYou can install these libraries using the following commands in the command prompt or terminal:\\n```\\npip install tensorflow\\npip install transformers\\n```\\n1. Load the pre-trained model\\nYou will need to load a pre-trained model for generating paraphrased text. Hugging Face provides several pre-trained models that you can use, such as T5, GPT-2, and BERT. For this example, we will use the T5 model.\\n\\nYou can load the T5 model using the following code:\\n```csharp\\nconst model = await tf.loadGraphModel('path/to/t5/model.json');\\n```\\n1. Load the tokenizer\\nYou will also need to load the tokenizer that was used to pre-process the input data for the pre-trained model. This is necessary for encoding and decoding the text.\\n\\nYou can load the tokenizer using the following code:\\n```arduino\\nconst tokenizer = new Tokenizer();\\n```\\n1. Process the input text\\nWhen the user submits the original text in the frontend, you will need to tokenize the text and encode it using the loaded tokenizer. This will convert the text into a numerical representation that can be processed by the model.\\n\\nYou can tokenize the input text using the following code:\\n```arduino\\nconst tokenizedText = tokenizer.encode(inputText);\\nconst inputIds = tf.tensor2d(tokenizedText, [1, tokenizedText.length], 'int32');\\n```\\n1. Generate the paraphrased text\\nOnce the input text has been encoded, you can use the pre-trained model to generate paraphrased text. You can pass the encoded input text to the model and specify parameters such as the maximum length of the output text, the number of beams to use for decoding, and whether or not to use early stopping.\\n\\nYou can generate the paraphrased text using the following code:\\n```php\\nconst outputs = await model.executeAsync({\\n    input_ids: inputIds,\\n    max_length: 50,\\n    num_beams: 10,\\n    early_stopping: true,\\n    return_tensors: true\\n});\\nconst paraphrasedText = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0].dataSync());\\nconsole.log(paraphrasedText);\\n```\\n1. Return the output to the frontend\\nFinally, you can return the generated paraphrased text to the frontend. You can do this by sending a JSON response that contains the paraphrased text.\\n\\nYou can return the output to the frontend using the following code:\\n```css\\nres.json({ paraphrasedText: paraphrasedText });\\n```\\nNote: The above code snippets are written in JavaScript and assume that you are using Node.js for the backend. You will need to modify the code to suit your specific requirements and programming language. Additionally, you will need to implement the code within a server-side script or application that can handle HTTP requests from the frontend.\"},\n",

       "  'output': 'Category theory is a branch of mathematics that studies the commonalities and patterns that exist across different mathematical structures. It has found applications in a wide range of fields, including computer science and software engineering. In the design domain, category theory can be helpful for organizing and structuring complex systems, identifying relationships between different components, and providing a framework for reasoning about their behavior.\\n\\nOne way category theory can be applied to the design of software systems is by using the concept of a \"category\" to model different components and their relationships. A category consists of a collection of objects and a collection of arrows (also called morphisms) that connect pairs of objects. These arrows represent the relationships between the objects and can be used to compose different components together to form more complex structures.\\n\\nIn the context of an ecommerce application, category theory could be used to model the different components of the system, such as products, customers, orders, and payments, and the relationships between them. For example, we could define an \"object\" for each of these components, along with a set of \"arrows\" that connect them. These arrows could represent different relationships, such as \"a customer can place an order,\" \"an order can contain one or more products,\" and \"a payment can be associated with an order.\"\\n\\nIn JavaScript, we could use a library like Category Theory for JavaScript (catj) to define the objects and arrows in our category. Here\\'s an example of how we could define a simple category for an ecommerce application:\\n```php\\nconst catj = require(\\'catj\\');\\n\\n// Define objects\\nconst Product = catj.object(\\'Product\\');\\nconst Customer = catj.object(\\'Customer\\');\\nconst Order = catj.object(\\'Order\\');\\nconst Payment = catj.object(\\'Payment\\');\\n\\n// Define arrows\\nconst PlaceOrder = catj.arrow(\\'PlaceOrder\\', Customer, Order);\\nconst OrderContainsProduct = catj.arrow(\\'OrderContainsProduct\\', Order, Product);\\nconst PaymentForOrder = catj.arrow(\\'PaymentForOrder\\', Payment, Order);\\n\\n// Compose arrows\\nconst PaymentForProduct = PaymentForOrder.compose(OrderContainsProduct);\\n\\n// Print composition table\\nconsole.log(catj.composeTable([PaymentForOrder, OrderContainsProduct], [PaymentForProduct]));\\n```\\nIn this example, we define four objects (Product, Customer, Order, and Payment) and three arrows (PlaceOrder, OrderContainsProduct, and PaymentForOrder). We then compose two of these arrows (PaymentForOrder and OrderContainsProduct) to create a new arrow (PaymentForProduct) that represents the relationship between a payment and a product. Finally, we use the `composeTable` function to print a table that shows the composition of PaymentForProduct in terms of PaymentForOrder and OrderContainsProduct.\\n\\nThis is just a simple example, but it illustrates how category theory can be used to model complex systems and provide a framework for reasoning about their behavior. By using categories to organize and structure different components, we can gain insights into the relationships between them and develop more robust and scalable software systems.'},\n",

       "  'output': \"Sure, designing a double-entry accounting system to manage student fees for school enrollment can be a complex task, but here are some general steps to consider:\\n\\n1. Identify the fee types: Start by identifying the different fee types that the school charges, such as tuition, transportation, uniform, books, etc.\\n2. Determine the payment options: Determine how the fees can be paid, whether it's monthly, semester, or yearly. You can also consider offering discounts for early payment or payment in full.\\n3. Create a chart of accounts: Create a chart of accounts that lists all the accounts that you will need to track the fees and payments. This will include accounts for the different fee types, student discounts, accounts receivable, and revenue accounts.\\n4. Set up a billing system: Once you have the chart of accounts set up, you can set up a billing system to generate invoices or bills for the fees owed by each student. The billing system should be able to calculate the fees based on the payment option and any applicable discounts.\\n5. Record the transactions: As payments are received, record them in the accounting system using double-entry bookkeeping. Each payment should be recorded in both the accounts receivable and revenue accounts.\\n6. Reconcile accounts: Regularly reconcile the accounts to ensure that the accounting records are accurate and up-to-date. This will involve comparing the accounts receivable balance to the revenue accounts balance to ensure that they match.\\n7. Generate financial statements: Finally, use the accounting data to generate financial statements, such as the balance sheet and income statement, which will provide a snapshot of the school's financial health.\\n\\nHere is an example of how the chart of accounts might look like:\\n\\n1. Revenue accounts:\\n\\t* Tuition revenue\\n\\t* Transportation revenue\\n\\t* Uniform revenue\\n\\t* Book revenue\\n2. Asset accounts:\\n\\t* Accounts receivable\\n\\t* Cash\\n3. Discount accounts:\\n\\t* Early payment discount\\n\\t* Full payment discount\\n\\t* Scholarship discount\\n4. Expense accounts:\\n\\t* Faculty salaries\\n\\t* Administrative salaries\\n\\t* Rent and utilities\\n\\t* Supplies\\n5. Liability accounts:\\n\\t* Unearned revenue (for fees paid in advance)\\n\\nWith this chart of accounts, you can set up a billing system that generates invoices for the different fee types, applying any applicable discounts. As payments are received, they can be recorded in the accounting system using double-entry bookkeeping to update the accounts receivable and revenue accounts. Regular reconciliations will help ensure the accounting records are accurate, allowing you to generate financial statements that can provide insight into the school's financial health.\"},\n",

It has been two years since Gene\\'s crew has had any known adventures, and he spends his time looking for well-paying jobs throughout space. The player begins the game with 250,000 wong in their bank account, which is the universally accepted currency and is roughly equivalent to the American dollar.\\n\\nTo survive in the game, the player must use their currency wisely. Whenever they spend money, the game will report their new total. Making wise spending decisions is essential for the player\\'s survival because serious errors could cause the game to end, and the player may die. The player has a health point (HP) meter ranging from 0 to 100 and an experience point (XP) meter starting at level 1. Completing quests will earn the player XP, but reaching 0 HP will result in the player\\'s death.\\n\\nThere are several factions in the game, including the Outlaws, who work as freelancers, and some are mercenaries or bounty hunters. They have a neutral position on most matters. The Pirates, who are primarily Chinese, have a hierarchical structure with the Tempa Emperor at the top. The Kei guild and Ban guild are two primary guilds of pirates. The Kei guild is known for successfully hunting down and killing the infamous outlaw \"Hot Ice\" Hilda, who stole the experimental spaceship XGP15A-II from them. They are also after Gene Starwind. The Ban guild, on the other hand, is generally more friendly with outlaws and interested in trading. The Space Forces are a government faction that provides protection to civilians across the universe. They have a clear hatred for all pirates and will often pursue them. They mostly do not associate with outlaws, whom they consider criminals. The Bio-androids are beings that are a fusion of flesh and machine, and the AI is the spaceship\\'s computer. Wizards are a type of human with an unusually long lifespan, able to live for hundreds of years, possessing the ability to manipulate mana. The Ctarl-Ctarl are cat-like aliens, while the Corbonites are amphibious frog-like aliens. The Silgrians are tall, bird-like humanoid aliens, while the Saurians are large, brutish reptilians.\\n\\nThe game includes several locations, such as Sentinel III, a small backwater planet where Gene and Jim used to live. Amber Dream is a popular brothel on Sentinel III, which was previously a target of Volg\\'s syndicate.

And inside of React, there are special tools called \"hooks\" that we can use to make our code simpler and easier to understand.\\n\\nHooks are like special helpers that let you use React features without having to make a whole new component. For example, you can use a hook called \"useState\" to add a \"state\" to your component. State is like a memory that helps your component remember things, like what a person typed into a form.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how you might use the \"useState\" hook:\\n```\\nimport { useState } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nfunction MyComponent() {\\n  const [name, setName] = useState(\\'Bob\\');\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      <p>Hello, {name}!</p>\\n      <input type=\"text\" value={name} onChange={e => setName(e.target.value)} />\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\nIn this example, the component starts with a state called \"name\" and it\\'s set to \"Bob\". Inside the component we have an input where the user can change the value of the name, and then we display the name in a <p> tag\\n\\nAnother example of a hook is the useEffect hook. useEffect lets you run some code after the component has rendered.\\n\\nHere\\'s an example of how you might use the \"useEffect\" hook:\\n```\\nimport { useEffect } from \\'react\\';\\n\\nfunction MyComponent() {\\n  const [data, setData] = useState(null);\\n\\n  useEffect(() => {\\n    fetch(\\'https://my-api.com/data\\')\\n      .then(response => response.json())\\n      .then(data => setData(data));\\n  }, []);\\n\\n  return (\\n    <div>\\n      {data ? <p>{data.message}</p> : <p>Loading...</p>}\\n    </div>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\nIn this example, the component makes a request to an API to get some data and then updates the component state with the data.\\n\\nHooks make it easy to share logic between components, and make your code more organized and easier to understand.'},\n",

       "  'output': 'FizzBuzz is a well-known coding challenge where you have to print out the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, you print \"Fizz\" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, you print \"Buzz.\" For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, you print \"FizzBuzz.\"\\n\\nTo design a circuit that plays FizzBuzz using 7400-series logic gates and 7-segment displays, you would need to break down the problem into smaller components. Here\\'s one possible approach:\\n\\n1. Create a counter that counts from 1 to 100. You can use a 4-bit binary counter such as the 74161, which has a synchronous reset input that you can use to reset the counter to 1.\\n2. Use logic gates to determine whether the current count is a multiple of three, five, or both. For example, you can use a combination of AND gates and comparators to check if the count is divisible by 3 or 5. If the count is divisible by both 3 and 5, then it is a multiple of 15 (i.e., FizzBuzz).\\n3. Use a decoder such as the 7447 or 74148 to convert the binary output of the counter into a seven-segment display output. You will need to connect the decoder to a 7-segment display, which can display the numbers 0-9 as well as some letters.\\n4. Use additional logic gates to control which output is displayed on the 7-segment display based on whether the current count is a multiple of 3, 5, or both. For example, if the count is a multiple of 3, you can display \"F\" on the leftmost segment of the display, and if it is a multiple of 5, you can display \"B\" on the rightmost segment. If it is a multiple of both, you can display \"FB\" on the display.\\n\\nHere\\'s a high-level diagram of what the circuit might look like:\\n```lua\\n+-------+      +-----+\\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------+\\n+-------+      +-----+       |\\n                 |           |\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+\\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\\n                                     |\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |  7-segment\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+  display\\n                 |                    |\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\\n                                     |\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\\n                 |           |       |\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\\n                                     |\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\\n```\\nIn this diagram, the 74161 counter is connected to three AND gates, each of which checks whether the current count is a multiple of 3, 5, or 15 (i.e., both 3 and 5).

This results in the optimization process balancing between minimizing the loss and keeping the weights small. The regularization term is added to the loss during training, and the model is optimized to minimize the total loss, including the regularization term.'},\n",

       " {'instruction': 'design a circuit to play FizzBuzz using 7400-series logic gates and 7-segment displays',\n",
       "  'output': 'FizzBuzz is a well-known coding challenge where you have to print out the numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, you print \"Fizz\" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, you print \"Buzz.\" For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, you print \"FizzBuzz.\"\\n\\nTo design a circuit that plays FizzBuzz using 7400-series logic gates and 7-segment displays, you would need to break down the problem into smaller components. Here\\'s one possible approach:\\n\\n1. Create a counter that counts from 1 to 100. You can use a 4-bit binary counter such as the 74161, which has a synchronous reset input that you can use to reset the counter to 1.\\n2. Use logic gates to determine whether the current count is a multiple of three, five, or both. For example, you can use a combination of AND gates and comparators to check if the count is divisible by 3 or 5. If the count is divisible by both 3 and 5, then it is a multiple of 15 (i.e., FizzBuzz).\\n3. Use a decoder such as the 7447 or 74148 to convert the binary output of the counter into a seven-segment display output. You will need to connect the decoder to a 7-segment display, which can display the numbers 0-9 as well as some letters.\\n4. Use additional logic gates to control which output is displayed on the 7-segment display based on whether the current count is a multiple of 3, 5, or both. For example, if the count is a multiple of 3, you can display \"F\" on the leftmost segment of the display, and if it is a multiple of 5, you can display \"B\" on the rightmost segment. If it is a multiple of both, you can display \"FB\" on the display.\\n\\nHere\\'s a high-level diagram of what the circuit might look like:\\n```lua\\n+-------+      +-----+\\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------+\\n+-------+      +-----+       |\\n                 |           |\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+\\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\\n                                     |\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |  7-segment\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+  display\\n                 |                    |\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\\n                                     |\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\\n                 |           |       |\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\\n| 74161 |------| AND |----| AND |---+\\n+-------+      +-----+    +-----+   |\\n                                     |\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\\n| 74161 |------| AND |-------------|   |\\n+-------+      +-----+             +-+-+\\n```\\nIn this diagram, the 74161 counter is connected to three AND gates, each of which checks whether the current count is a multiple of 3, 5, or 15 (i.e., both 3 and 5).

Define the mean wait time as 2 minutes. The exponential distribution has a parameter lambda, which is the inverse of the mean. So, lambda = 1/2.\\n2. Generate a set of uniform random numbers between 0 and 1. You can use any programming language or software to generate these random numbers.\\n3.

       "  'output': \"Traveling is an enriching experience that can have many benefits. One of the most exciting aspects of traveling is exposure to new cultures. There is no better place to experience a new culture than Taiwan. Taiwan is a country that is full of culture, history, and delicious food. As someone who has traveled to Taiwan, I can attest to the many benefits of experiencing this beautiful country.\\n\\nOne of the best things about traveling to Taiwan is trying new foods. Taiwan is known for its night markets, which are full of delicious and unique foods. One of the most famous Taiwanese dishes is stinky tofu. As the name suggests, stinky tofu has a strong odor. When I first tried it, I was hesitant because of the smell. However, after taking a bite, I was surprised at how good it tasted. The texture was crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and it had a unique flavor that I had never experienced before. Trying new foods is a great way to experience a new culture, and Taiwan has plenty of opportunities to do so.\\n\\nAnother benefit of traveling to Taiwan is exploring historical sites. Taiwan has a rich history, and there are many historical sites to visit. One of the most interesting things I saw during my trip was the Meat-shaped Stone at the National Palace Museum in Taipei. The Meat-shaped Stone is a piece of jasper that is carved to look like a piece of braised pork belly. The stone is incredibly detailed and looks like a real piece of meat. It was surprising to see something so realistic that was created hundreds of years ago. The National Palace Museum is full of other interesting artifacts that give a glimpse into Taiwan's history.\\n\\nIn addition to trying new foods and exploring historical sites, traveling to Taiwan also provides an opportunity to experience the kindness of the Taiwanese people. Taiwanese people are known for their hospitality and friendly nature. During my trip, I had many interactions with locals who were eager to help me navigate the city or recommend places to visit. One example of this kindness was when I was lost in a night market and a local vendor offered to walk me to my destination. These interactions made my trip even more enjoyable and helped me to appreciate the Taiwanese culture even more.\\n\\nAnother benefit of traveling to Taiwan is the opportunity to practice a new language. Mandarin Chinese is the official language of Taiwan, and while many Taiwanese people speak English, there are still plenty of opportunities to practice Mandarin. Learning a new language can be a challenging but rewarding experience, and it can help travelers to connect with the local culture even more.\\n\\nFinally, traveling to Taiwan provides an opportunity to step outside of one's comfort zone. Traveling to a new country can be intimidating, especially if one is not familiar with the language or culture. However, stepping outside of one's comfort zone can be a transformative experience. It allows travelers to challenge themselves and to learn and grow in new ways. Traveling to Taiwan allowed me to push past my comfort zone and to experience a new culture in a way that I never could have imagined.\\n\\nIn conclusion, traveling to Taiwan is an excellent way to experience a new culture. From trying new foods to exploring historical sites, Taiwan has plenty to offer travelers. Additionally, the kindness of the Taiwanese people, the opportunity to practice a new language, and the chance to step outside of one's comfort zone make traveling to Taiwan a truly enriching experience. If you have the opportunity to travel to Taiwan, I highly recommend it.\"},\n",

Syndication.\\nyou can see at the top we use dual logos. So the quick books logo is always at the top right, and the partner Logo is on the left.\\nWe strategically chose images that fit each industry. And you can see below in these samples we played around with the buttons to determine\\nwhere\\nthe best performance is. based on button placement, and determine that\\nthe 2 green ones top placement performs best.\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n08:11\\nand do we have numbers on how the messaging may have done like between. Notify Mendelssohn and margin Edge, like what resonated better with the audience.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n08:23\\nWell, their audiences are a bit different because they\\'re different industries. For the most part we can go back and analyze and take a look at them.\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n08:32\\nI know we did a series. We did more for some of the partners than others, so we don\\'t have as much to kind of compare to, but we can look at that, because we have the data and the performance, and each of them I\\'m asking is like, I see one of them is Nsp. Mandelson. The rest are. Is these\\nWhat the feedback we got from is this was that they\\'re looking more for us to do a\\ncustomization approach in terms of messaging.\\nThey have their own solution integrated to quick books. We have our own. So how do we make that peanut butter, jelly, sandwich kind of thing approach right with is. so i\\'m just wondering if one of them resonated better where we have more of a connected messaging.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n09:18\\nOkay.\\nwe\\'ll take a look at that.\\n \\nGina Madson\\n09:22\\nYeah, I know for notify and margin edge we provide spear with the co-value proposition\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n09:28\\ncontent and messaging. So yeah, it\\'d be curious to see if we do better with those that you guys did. we are working towards that Co. Marketing messaging. Okay?\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n09:44\\nWell, I think you\\'ll see some of that. a little Further, we have a surprise to show you.\\n \\nShirin Safavy\\n09:54\\nOkay, and moving on to the part Prospect Partner Newsletter. So\\nthe data below is for the first issue, which went out pretty recently on November first.\\nclicks look good click to open rates look pretty great.\\nSo\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n10:12\\nthe one thing we learned from this is we obviously need more content. So some of this is is also reaching out or utilizing some industry content as well. For educational purposes that we think you know they would be interested in, but we\\'d love more.\\nI\\ninto it related content.\\nfor these newsletters moving forward.\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n10:36\\nSorry I, my mindful, but I mentioned here. I think this for recruit. Probably.\\nso. I almost feel like in the title is grabbing their attention because quick books is a big name. That\\'s the o open rate that shows is.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n10:54\\nand the CTO. Specifically, which is great\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n10:58\\nWonder if we can align. And this is our problem. If we can align those leads to how we closed internally, or I\\'ll be the right ones.\\n \\nGina Madson\\n11:10\\nSo this is the the Newsletter that we just started sending monthly Anila, and it\\'s going to the long term nurture. So the leads that have already gone through sales and haven\\'t converted yet so that this kind of like our drip continuing to message to them.\\nso we\\'ve only yeah. I had the last month, really. And then the second one went out the beginning of December. But that\\'s for sure something we\\'re trying to track internally, and you know, like pass over. If someone re-engages\\nand starts to raise our hand at the bottom of every Newsletter. It\\'s a call to action to, you know, book time with LED basically so we\\'re trying to promote that with these.\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n11:50\\nSo, Gina, we don\\'t know how many we got through meetings with LED\\n \\nGina Madson\\n11:54\\nas of this one. I don\\'t believe any have been booked with end from the Newsletter right now, because they\\'re overly a newsletter, and they\\'re like, Wait, this is this is nothing. So we\\nagain, if if it was all a 100% Qsp. Content, and they may not feel relevant either. So we need to\\nchange up the mix of content. We had, you know, more industry, available news and\\ncontent available. So that\\'s kind of what we use, but\\nthat isn\\'t the plan long term.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n12:26\\nRight?\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n12:32\\nOkay?\\n \\nShirin Safavy\\n12:34\\nOkay. So this chart on the right shows engagement time on the\\npartner sites between February and October of this year.\\nYou can see the time on the site is pretty low. It\\'s not where we want to be. We want to increase engagement to keep people coming back.\\nSo that is definitely something. We\\'ll continue to work on\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n12:59\\nOne thing to call out there to the time on site\\nwill help with refreshing, you know. As we get more content they\\'ll have more reason to come back more frequently to, you know, spend time on site. They\\nright now we\\'re using the site more to come for one purpose like to register for something, and then they pop off. What we want to do is is, keep them there. Keep them looking, going deeper into the site, and so forth. So\\nwe have talked to Gina about, you know, building out. Maybe some industry pages and things like that. what we can do as far as promotion of that site is limited because it\\'s on on 24\\nSomething to think about in the future is potentially building it like a micro site or something that we could actually do some social promotion to\\nwe\\'re limited in that now, but content is a big factor in keeping them there\\n \\nGina Madson\\n13:54\\nright. This is our on 24 hub, so it\\'s not a main website. but it\\'s where our lower content and our Webinar registrations are housed. So\\nnot\\nexactly a main partner website, but that is something that\\'s in the works for\\nfor next year. What I was also thinking right for future discussion is.\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n14:15\\nwe have this. We\\'re also internally working on our quickbooks.com site\\nto add partner specific page, and we have to drive that page also. So when you talk about a micro site\\nthat could be a gateway coming into our quick books. Right? so we can drive traffic one. Another driver would be our directory. So we\\'re hoping to get that more robust, and that\\'s going to be our partners outward facing to customers.\\nOkay. So how do we help them generate on the for marketing piece there? Also?\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n14:58\\nOkay.\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n15:01\\nSorry. Taking notes.\\n \\nShirin Safavy\\n15:05\\nI think it is important to note just looking at this chart here that visitors have been increasing.\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n15:11\\nSo, we\\'re headed in the right direction.\\n \\nShirin Safavy\\n15:14\\nAnd\\nnow that we\\'re seeing momentum with visitors, we just want to keep them there longer and keep them coming back.\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n15:23\\nExactly.\\n \\nShirin Safavy\\n15:28\\nOh, now it\\'s happening again.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n15:30\\nI\\n \\nShirin Safavy\\n15:31\\nThere we go.\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n15:37\\nOkay.\\n \\nShirin Safavy\\n15:38\\nSo campaign. Sorry, guys.\\nit\\'s like it knows everybody is on this. Call it doesn\\'t want to cooperate.\\nSo looking at the nurture campaign results, As I mentioned earlier, we had 2 separate tracks, 5 touches each.\\nYou can see we\\'re pretty close to industry averages. Those are listed at the very bottom of this chart.\\nSome touches performed better than others. we\\'ve recently been working on rewriting some of this copy, so we do look forward to seeing how they\\'ll measure in the next few months. Compared\\nto these measurements.\\nand the Msp. Track actually performed much better than is V. Which makes sense. When you think about it, because most of the assets we used, or\\nvery closely related to Msp.\\nfor example, this third touch here performed really well.\\nSo.\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n16:42\\nhmm.\\n \\nShirin Safavy\\n16:44\\nAnother thing I wanted to point out is that in the beginning of our engagement we were sending these emails manually. So Spear was manually going into mailchimp and sending the touches out each week.\\nand as we added to the series, and had a complete set of 5, we were able to recreate the nurture within mailch as an automated series.\\nSo and gina i\\'m sure you remember that.\\nSo I want to be sure that you know these numbers are based on the automated series, not the manual.\\n \\nGina Madson\\n17:14\\nOkay.\\n \\nShirin Safavy\\n17:19\\nAnd this is a summary slide of the partner Webinar programs for post-event promotion.\\nThese partners receive content syndication leads after their webinar.\\nAnd the reason there\\'s no costs per lead for the first one for margin edge is because we used and make good for that project\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n17:42\\nfor these numbers.\\nI I guess I need to understand what the definition of lead is. is it just? if it is just attendees. Then let\\'s call it out. 1 50 attendees right? Because when we\\'d say, when we talk about these numbers to sales, they like leads\\noh, leads. They consider as qualified. So, unless we have a qualification, we should probably say attendees. The other thing is from for my team. I think we we\\'re at a point, Gina, where we could look at these coming in. And if we, how can we\\ncontinue the journey of where these are from the partner, and that\\'s going to be a tough one.\\n \\nGina Madson\\n18:24\\nYeah. So with these ones we have report the attendees and the registrants separately. And then this was actually after the fact. After the Webinar. We syndicated it as a piece that someone could go out and register for and targeted that syndication through spears, various\\nagencies right to those targeted audiences. So these leads are people that clicked on it and said, oh, I want to watch that Webinar i\\'m, you know, going to register. So then we pass them over to the Qsp. And they fit the audience criteria that you\\'re looking for. Specifically.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n19:00\\nSo\\nit it\\'s kinda in between. They\\'ve raised their hand. They\\'re interested, and they fit the right profile as\\nas a lead.\\n \\nGina Madson\\n19:08\\nright? And so the feedback we\\'ve gotten from hinge and margin edge so where I Haven\\'t heard definitively from asterisk. But that is, these are really good quality, and that they are the contacts that they want at the companies that they want to be talking to\\nbut it\\'s been mixed as they\\'re reaching out to them, and that that lead is like\\nvery familiar with it, and understand who they are and why they\\'re reaching out to. Okay, yeah.\\nI just clicked on that. It does sound interesting to me. But why are you calling me right. So like it is definitely a top of funnel lead. But it\\'s getting them like I said, the right people at the right companies to fill that top of funnel. Then it\\'s up to the partner to really nurture them.\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n19:50\\nYeah, i\\'m wondering if we could do anything with and lift all this and and lift it a partner that we have\\nwhere you know they\\'re looking at data and a lot of vertical specific stuff. And so, even just to understand like for margin edge, or if we bucket them into verticals, so hinge full margin edge if they do a concer i\\'m just making this up. I don\\'t know construction, or you know a\\ninventory management solution. What are the profiles that we\\'re looking at? Because there\\'s going to be a lot of partners. I see specifically that are playing in the same vertical. And so how do we segment each of their specialty into that? So that\\'s something that we could, you know, do but i\\'m just mentioning to.\\nGina Lexi and Louise is\\nif there\\'s an if if we can create a almost like a propensity model on for each of the verticals.\\n \\nHoward Sewell\\n20:49\\nquick question. Actually, we\\'re going to touch upon\\npropensity a little later on in the in the deck quick. This question almost for for both teams. But i\\'m wondering in light of Gina\\'s comment about the mixed response to outreach. Can we help provide guidance, or maybe sample scripts, or anything to these partners, one\\nfor their outreach, because we hear that a lot with content syndication programs occasionally, whether the clients where leads get thrown over the fence to sales. Sales thinks they are following up on people that have expressed interest in the product. Basically\\nAnd there is so. So there is sort of like a disconnect when you know. So i\\'m just wondering if that\\'s something that we can\\nmaybe help\\nguide in a\\nin a gentle way, and improve that.\\nImprove that response for sure, open to it. I mean, we are pretty\\n \\nGina Madson\\n21:40\\nclear with the marketer at the queue at the partner right? That like that\\'s what happened. This is what happened, but i\\'m not there controlling how they\\'re passing into sales, and I don\\'t know right. I think march and edge is an exception. but for him to go I know that they don\\'t have refined\\nnurture process right and different levels of sales who would be reaching out at different times. So for sure, it\\'s something that we can do better and enable our usps with better.\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n22:13\\nOkay.\\n \\nHoward Sewell\\n22:15\\ncool.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n22:16\\nYeah, I think we\\'ll touch on it a little further down to, as you know, some of the challenges with understanding, you know. Measurement on the back end of how they, how they\\'re doing, and how they\\'re, you know, moving through the funnel.\\ncertainly would love to be more involved in, you know. Get more transparent feedback from them, so that we can put that into our campaigns and follow up\\nyour screen.\\n \\nShirin Safavy\\n22:45\\nGreat. So I will hand things over to Sandy.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n22:48\\nAll right next slide, please.\\nSo we asked Gina upfront here. if she could do a swat analysis of our relationship.\\nso that we could, you know, ensure we\\'re giving the best service possible. You know. What do we do? Well, what can we improve? I won\\'t. Go through and read all of this, but I wanted it as part of the deck, because it is something that we\\'re working. You know.\\nWe\\'re keeping front of mine and working on some of the things that you mentioned, where you know we do really well at the kind of lead, generation side on content, syndication and campaign execution, working on the webinars content.\\nplanning and strategy. and then I I do think our relationship between our team is is strong that communication is great.\\nSome areas that we can improve our, you know, on timelines. we\\'re actively looking at ways that we can.\\nyou know, keep that. Keep the projects moving quickly, making sure that we\\'re hitting those timelines, and we, you know we added more resources onto the account as well, and Lynn and her team have been working harder on, you know.\\nrefining the the messaging and trying to get those. You know the audience messaging just right. So we\\'re gonna continuously work on that\\nand we\\'re looking at different vendors to also to see how we can refine the audience a little bit better for you as well, and finding new ways to reach. You know your target Audience.\\nnext slide, please.\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n24:26\\nSo I just on that.\\nI know Gina and I talk quite a bit and thank you for sharing the learning on the content piece. Right? I mean, I know that, you guys you\\'ve tried and stuff. But honestly, we have agencies that we work with very in a, you know, deeper workshop place, and they\\'ve been on board, and they really integrated so\\nhonestly from that point of view, we could get to some of the content that we\\'ve already created. And one thing that we have put in place is Harry on our team is doing the overall messaging, and we just tap into those, you know messages, right? So we\\'re. We are putting things in place that are better because we understand that there\\'s different places where we are going to use that content from. So you know, there\\'s there\\'s improvements happening on our site as well.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n25:14\\nOh, absolutely. We know that there there are things in place. I know some things have been stuck in legal, and there have been some challenges with people being gone, and you know, nothing moves as quickly as as we would like them to, but we definitely have probably hit\\nthe end of the content that we have now. So we\\'re eagerly awaiting, you know, new assets moving forward. But if there\\'s ever a need to do that, and we hope to be doing that more with some of the partners themselves with the marketplace program.\\nThat, you know. That would be wonderful, too, is to be able to show up to share some of that.\\nwe also looked at some of the opportunities and threats just to get some feedback on the industry itself. and you know, if there\\'s any gaps in our service, or where we could help more. and so we were listening on here. We realized that you know most of the social has moved over to corporate.\\nBut if there\\'s anything that we can do from the standpoint of creating content or posts, or anything to you know. Move that along faster. Obviously we\\'re here for you.\\nLet\\'s see here.\\nwe\\'re doing our best to get the most out of your budget to drive new leads for the Qs themselves, and also for the partner Acquisition.\\nI think here we all see that the industry is slowing slightly. and budgets are, you know.\\nbeing held closely.\\nbut I still think that we\\'ve seen a lot of successes, and we\\'re able to apply that kind of moving forward to get more and more efficient at helping those partners, you know, find better ways to reach their audiences and target those messages more clearly.\\nNext slide, please.\\nSo overall what we think went well was the communication between our teams. You know we\\'ve had really open honest discussions, but things don\\'t work, and when they do Gina has been great at sharing everything that she sees on her side that help, you know. Help us all do better.\\nwe\\'ve had the ability to test different approaches and pivot. You know quickly when things aren\\'t working.\\nwe have some resources in place that help us, you know. Get better organized and communicate better. I think we review things very quickly. The teams got open flow of communication between the channels and the\\nthe regular meetings as well. we have some flexibility and adding\\nadditional resources on the sphere side when there\\'s upticks in work. So we\\'ve brought more people onto the team, and we I think we have a solid team in place.\\nNext slide, please.\\nSome of the challenges we, you know we had a hard time with that live Webinar\\nevent promotion upfront. We learned from that, and I think we\\'ve been able to do a lot better.\\nReplacing that offer with the on demand recordings and doing the promotions on the back end. also increasing kind of the mix of content that we have to work with so ebooks and case studies and things like that. when possible. Ebooks, obviously are, are one of the\\nthe pieces most in demand.\\nyou we discussed the partner commitment needed to kind of complete the post event. Follow up, and maybe this is an opportunity for us to help help you help them by creating some.\\nmaybe best practices, as Ha! Hey? Howard had mentioned on scripts, and, you know, follow up emails to kind of level out the playing field for those partners that may not have the resources to do that.\\nWe recommended kind of the creation of some\\ntop of funnel ebook assets that incorporate things like case studies or snippets and testimonials. But that has a little bit more of a thought leadership. Focus. Those do much better in the ads than you know, sending them to just landing pages to go kind of look for content themselves.\\nOur lack of ebook and white paper assets kind of made some of the lead generation efforts to little challenging for contents, education and and paid media advertising.\\nSo we we, as I said before, we could use a little bit more of a mix of assets to kind of freshen those nurtures, and continue with the monthly newsletters. populating those. So there\\'s no big surprises there\\nmessaging.\\nyou know we did find that we need some differentiation on the messaging between the audiences. They were a little too similar, I think, as you said we\\'re working on it. It\\'s been getting better and better.\\nthe Intuit team has provided us more information, any background such as you know, surveys or any feedback that you got from your events last week, that potentially we can kind of incorporate that into the messaging\\nto make it a little bit. You know more refined\\nreporting as an area that we still are having some challenges, I would say, in in measuring how we\\'re doing from a revenue, perspective and opportunities to a generated from the programs that we\\'re doing so potentially getting salesforce access or\\nregular reporting from that could help also getting some reporting from the partners themselves\\nwould be beneficial.\\nthe on 24 landing pages are acceptable, but\\nthe fact that there\\'s only kind of one version of the form makes some of the lead generation that we want to do.\\nyou know, unattainable we recommend, maybe designing and building additional landing pages with new forms and mailchimp potentially in that in the future\\nthat will help with the lead Gen. Needs, and enable us to kind of measure more\\nthat lack of engagement tracking and the results from meet the experts. As we go forward, so we can kind of see how we\\'re doing on those that would be helpful as well.\\nand let\\'s see mailchimp, you know. Mail 10 third. There are some\\nareas there where we can\\'t quite build some of the templates that we want to Some of the modules just had to be kind of tweaked to translate\\nvisually in mailchimp\\nbut we were able to kind of overcome that with the newsletter\\nareas of opportunity the content development is is one of those areas where\\nwe could use a little mix of content for the industry pages potentially creating content that\\'s specific to those different industries. So whether it\\'s construction or inventory management.\\nmaybe creating some more content that\\'s specific to those industries. the potential to maybe survey or interview partners to to find topics of interest, or, you know, get some some expertise on messaging from them\\nidentifying cop topics of interest from your conference. I know we haven\\'t had a chance to talk about how it went last week, but we look forward to hearing a little bit about that\\nthe creation of the partner. Videos case studies and blogs that you\\'re talking about will be exciting. for the New Year.\\npotentially refreshing. That messaging based on, you know, audience surveys or interviews. is a a potential area of opportunity, and also to extend that nurture.\\nconsider, maybe adding the event in a box to the menu of services for the partners for the the partner marketplace.\\nwhere, since\\nmany of the partners are getting back into doing live events, maybe that\\'s an in the area of opportunity where we can package that, like we talked about earlier in the year into a program.\\nand then building a monthly program for tracking on the activities that we\\'re doing for the partners. So maybe there\\'s a way to incentivize the partners, maybe to send back revenue or opportunity results from those Content syndication programs and other things.\\nso that we can kind of get some more 2 way feedback.\\nAny questions there?\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n34:08\\nOkay.\\n \\nGina Madson\\n34:09\\nNot a good question. But just I think on it\\ncomment for the Content development. I mean any of this is something we had talked about at different points, but as we get more Qsps and have more verticalized focused content for recruiting or finding customers, I should say, for our Qsps\\nwith on 24, if we had a deeper set of content right. We could have some more of those always on kind of\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n34:36\\ngo ahead.\\n \\nGina Madson\\n34:37\\nGoogle as as well as complementary content syndication campaigns going that are for the vertical. So then we\\'re getting and passing weeds for partners, right? Which I know we\\'re not yet at from a corporate standpoint, but that\\'s kind of an option to explore down the road.\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n34:55\\nYeah, I actually made a note sending on and you, Haven\\'t here is.\\ncan we maybe do a a focus group with the partners right? Specifically? one. A focus group for is one for Msps and really understand. Look, this is what we\\'ve delivered so far. What?\\nWhat is all the things that you\\nmay use right.\\nThey\\'ve been doing business before even they became our partner\\nfor a long time. They know how to get leads and how we land those. So if we were to leverage that information and their expertise. How do we enable them? Maybe they might be something that you know, because we\\'re all there with some marketers, and\\nyou get into our little bubble of like, hey marketing, should we do this? But sometimes when you hear things from sales, it\\'s a light bulb going off. Oh, wait! We could have tweaked it this way, so it\\'d be great, because we have a lot of activities under the belt. And so how do we create the next, you know, level of\\nenablement for the partners. If that\\'s focus group that they\\'ll be open to and trust me. Our qs are pretty open, and their voice their opinion. It\\'d be great to have those, you know. Call it the suggestion. I know you already have that on your board.\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n36:09\\nRight?\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n36:10\\nYeah, I think that would be wonderful.\\nThe more information they have, the more you know more we can refine.\\nand with that said, we do have an in one idea that Howard is going to talk about with an an additional partner that we work with.\\nNext slide. Please\\n \\nHoward Sewell\\n36:29\\ncut my cue. That\\'s your cue\\nI got. I got given a couple of slides, so i\\'d feel useful. which is very nice. yeah, i\\'ll go through this quickly, but you know, full disclosure. Rev. Is a a very new partner relationship for us. In fact, it\\'s, you know we Haven\\'t even really formalized\\nthe relationship. But they\\'re a really interesting company, and one that we on the spear side.\\nI think that we could leverage across a pretty broad swath of client engagements, and we\\'re in a mode right now in the early stages where we\\'ve done a couple of little tests with a couple of clients, and we\\'re looking to do a few more. 3.\\nTo gauge how clients could leverage the the data that comes out of these tests, which i\\'ll explain so Rev. Is a. A company. Basically it\\'s a AI-based technology, and they build a\\na model of your Icp ideal customer profile based on a list of your best customers. So you give them a list of 20 customers, and say, these are: If we had another 500 of these, that would be, that would be great, and they feed that into their model and output.\\na couple of things. One is other companies that look like those same customers.\\nAnd secondly, what are the common characteristics that define those companies beyond the usual pharmographic. So\\ngeography, company, size, industry, etc., but also what Rev. Calls hexagraphics, which is basically information on how companies execute. So\\nare they an early adopter or a late adopter? Are they focused on customer service, that sort of thing, and they also they build that model based on the list the company provides. They run it against a database of 6 million dollars, 6 million companies.\\nThey identify those key characteristics, and then they also come back to us with. Here are other companies that look like\\nthe companies you\\'re telling us\\nare\\nyour best customers.\\nIf you can go to the next slide.\\nShreen. Thank you.\\nso this has been. we\\'ve done this a couple of times now. In fact, we\\'re presenting our second to another client this later this week, but it has the potential to be a useful tool, we believe, on a couple of fronts one\\nit could identify other, but other Isvs and Msps that are out there that are most similar to the partners that you want best to capture and bring into the program. It may identify\\nspecific.\\nhigh potential segment. So we may. It may be a way to identify\\nthat we didn\\'t realise it, but the partners who sell to this type of company, or that have the certain characteristic end up being our top performing partners. And if we learn more about\\nwhat makes those\\npartners your best\\npartners, it could help inform things like messaging and content, and and that sort of thing. So our offer to you, he says, is to is to take a list of your top partners, and literally all we need is like 20 company names in their urls.\\nWe\\'ll hand it over to Rev. They\\'ll provide us, and there\\'s no charge for this.\\nThe 2 outputs that I mentioned. They\\'ll give us a list of these hexagraphics that are common to those companies. The one important note. There is, the larger the companies\\nthe better the insights. And we\\'ve learned this the hard way, so you know, and then it has a lot to do with web presence. So the the larger the web presence the company has, the more information Rev. Can capture, so it preferably be\\npartners on the upper tiers of where you guys kind of operate, and they\\'ll also provide us\\na sample list of lookalike companies from their database.\\nAnd then, if we found the data compelling, and this is completely without obligation. We could then look at.\\nmaybe acquiring data from Rev. They also have a lead generation platform which operates in a similar sort of content syndication\\nmodel where you go to them and say, hey, i\\'ll a\\nX amount per lead, if you can find me. Other companies that look like these partners. So again the ask is.\\ngive us a list of 20 companies. We\\'ll come back to you with some data.\\nno charge for doing so. The the ask in in from our side is, Tell us what you think\\nis this: is this interesting? Is this useful? Could you use it?\\nIs it compelling, is it? It doesn\\'t really tell us anything we didn\\'t already know?\\nbut it\\'s an exercise we\\'d love to.\\nWe\\'d love to run.\\nand I think that\\'s it.\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n41:31\\nHoward. Thank you for for reviewing this with us, and the answer to your questions is all the above.\\nHowever, we do have already a vendor that we work with, and we we\\'re working with the the vendor from a sales perspective, too, because they\\'re connected there, so that you know the partners and lift. And we we do do all of these things that you\\'re you\\'re mentioning with them.\\n \\nHoward Sewell\\n41:59\\nSo okay\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n42:00\\nappreciate the opportunity.\\n \\nHoward Sewell\\n42:02\\nYeah, absolutely. And I confess it again. It\\'s a relatively new relationship\\nfor us. We were excited about it because\\nit allows us to kind of\\nbring some technology to bear help. Refine the kind of work that we do. Everything that Sandy and Sri have been talking about content development email creative, you know targeting, etc. So we wanted to make it available to you. If frankly, if you want to do it, even as just a point of comparison.\\nyou know, next to what you\\'re getting from the other company. That is absolutely fine, but it\\'s entirely your your.\\nyour your option.\\nSo\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n42:39\\nthank you.\\n \\nHoward Sewell\\n42:40\\nYou\\'re welcome\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n42:42\\nnext slide, please.\\nSo we put together a quick action plan. Some ideas, maybe, for next steps for you and the team to take a look at and\\nlet us know. You know you want us to move forward with this, but we\\'re move we\\'re in the development process. Sorry i\\'m a little tongue tied. we\\'re in the development process for that with the cin 7 evoke\\nso potentially it\\'s As soon as that\\'s completed we could write some blog articles on it to show how those like integrated solutions\\nhelp, you know SMS and use that in the Newsletter in the resource center.\\nwe could continue to work on some new industry specific topics to fill in the gaps in the resource center in the newsletter as well.\\nAnother idea is to create a short script video script for that ebook as well to use in prom promotions\\nto move forward with the survey questions for partners. And maybe in this case, if we don\\'t do the survey, we could do a workshop where we could get more, you know in depth understanding\\nof partner needs, but that\\nthe idea here was to get ideas on their interests and topics for the office hours, webinars, but also new content pieces.\\nAnalyze those survey results and suggest and some new topics for Webinars moving forward. So these are sort of like quick hits that we\\'ve identified.\\nIs there anything there that you would like to add to, or anything like?\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n44:30\\nJust a questions being that you can talk in a minute to get ready for the other for the next meeting.\\nSo for the top of the funnel, content. These should be in the mark, the marketing service catalog, because initially, we had. We had helped the partners. Now we\\'re saying, we need to Co. Invest. So\\nif we don\\'t have the video, and I\\'m. I\\'m forgetting, Louise. If we don\\'t have the video or the blog article, or whatever from Sphere and Msc. Then we should probably add these, and that needs to be funneled through the marketing service catalogue.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n45:07\\nGotcha. Yeah, okay.\\nOn the next slide we wanted to show you. I believe it\\'s the next slide. we wanted to show you\\nsomething that we created using some of the initial data from the send 7 ebook process. We\\'re still working on the ebook itself. But this is one example of what we can do with some of those data insights, and creating other pieces of contents that could extend the life of the campaigns, and this here is a infographic we\\'ll provide the link to the sample right now. since Ivan has not seen this yet, either. So it\\'s hot off the press. But this is\\none exciting idea one way to visualize some of that data\\nthat\\nthat they provided as well.\\nso our thought was to potentially, you know, turn this into a video or something as well. If the the client is interested, the prospect I have to jump off. But just 2 things. For example, one is, and we don\\'t have to answer it on this call. One is that\\n \\nAnila Baseel\\n46:15\\nwe\\'re trying to be out there in technology software? so how do we compete? And what are we not doing today that we could potentially look into right\\nas next step for F 23. And the other is that I know Gina is amazing, and the teams really great. And you guys have been working amazingly. what else do you need from us? For me? From Gina, or anything that would make your lives a little bit easier other than content? what you know how. How else can we help you?\\nbe more successful?\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n46:48\\nI think, understanding a little bit more about your overall goals for your you know your program itself and your slice of the business, I think, and understanding what you\\'re trying to achieve for next year will help us.\\nYou do do better.\\ndo you have anything to add in here, Howard.\\nunderstanding a little bit more about your lifetime goals, and how we measure success, you know, moving forward.\\n \\nHoward Sewell\\n47:18\\nYeah, I mean, it\\'s always great to understand the larger goals and the grander objectives I would defer to you, Sandy, and the team being closer to the day to day than I am. But again it\\'s it\\'s a great\\nrelationship, and one that is very collaborative, and a lot of information flowing back and forth. So\\nyou know we are at this point. We are.\\nyou know, and proving on\\nthings that are\\ngenerally working pretty well. So but we\\'ll, you know we\\'ll, we\\'ll take that, you know. We\\'ll take that request away and come back with ideas as well, so that\\'s fair.\\n \\nGarrett Lawrence\\n47:59\\nGarrett. Did you have a question? No, i\\'m just gonna say, I mean, I agree anything as we learn about the specifics behind your goals and objectives that\\'s really helpful, you know, if there\\'s additional needs in terms of thought, leadership, and building your stature. If there\\'s anything in customer, partner, advocacy you have, there\\'s different things that we can contribute to. So happy to explore that and come back to you with some some thoughts.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n48:22\\nThat\\'s great. Thank you guys. I have to jump off, and this is really awesome. Thank you so much.\\nGina Lexi. Do you have any questions?\\n \\nGina Madson\\n48:34\\nNo, i\\'m excited to see the ebook and the infographic, for some of them looks great, too, so that\\'ll be great to have is the first one, and it sounds like march and edges back on track to move forward with theirs, too. So 2 of those up there to test in separate markets very different audiences. So right?\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n48:52\\nOkay, I think I have a last slide. Sorry, and this is just next steps.\\nIf you could\\nadvances side one more for me.\\nI think next steps. Obviously, you know. Consider what\\'s in here. We\\'ll send you the Dac so we could develop a project plan, you know, moving forward. Some of the things we want to do is test some new vendors for the app marketplace campaign. we\\'d like to get approval\\nan an understanding of what we\\'re going to be moving forward with. We have a I think a straw man as to what kind of what our next\\nquarter looks like, but maybe developing in the that plan out for Q. 4 2023, the April to June timeframe.\\nwe will expedite the completion or we would like to expedite the completion of the ebook asset that your team is working on for content syndication.\\nand we will share the infographic internally. And we\\'re\\nworking on the last touches for the ebook for cin 7 as well, and then potentially launching that partner survey or doing a workshop, whichever is best there. And if you discuss internally that you want to, you know, try out the Rev.\\n \\nHoward Sewell\\n50:16\\nOffer the insight, and i\\'m going to take an action item there, if I may, and that\\'s too, because frankly, I don\\'t know the answer to this is what makes them different, if at all, from in left.\\nBecause I i\\'d i\\'d want to make sure that there\\'s you know the differentiation and a value. Add there that would make even that exercise worthwhile. And so why Don\\'t? Why, don\\'t I find that out first, and then Gene and team we can. We can get back to you as to whether we still think that\\'s maybe worth\\nconsidering. So\\n \\nGina Madson\\n50:52\\nyeah, that\\'d be great. I\\'m curious to know myself. I\\'m sure there are some variations there, and\\nI think a test would be fascinating. We just we\\'ve pulled back a little bit from our recruitment focus to emphasize more of our with partner marketing and activity. So I think that\\'s maybe where there\\'s a little hesitation to immediately jump in and test it. But yeah, and and again, just to be clear, I mean, this is just you know\\n \\nHoward Sewell\\n51:17\\nus running and running your customer list through their database, coming back with a few slides, and that\\'s as far as it\\nneeds to go. So it\\'s basically just it\\'s free data. But again, to the extent that you maybe are already getting all those insights.\\nI just want to make sure it\\'s worth even that amount of time, and that\\'ll be on us to find out, and we\\'ll get back to you.\\n \\nGina Madson\\n51:37\\nYeah, I mean, we do have a within. Let\\'s not just quickly say, but we are still struggling to target effectively. We want to recruit into our program. So if there could be deeper levels of insight or takeaways or insight, you know, period information is generally helpful. So\\n \\nHoward Sewell\\n51:55\\nI I would love to test it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Well, that\\'s great. Well, let me. Let me find out what the differences are, and then we can. We can. We can well work with Sandy and team, and we can talk about what the next steps might be.\\n \\nUnknown Speaker\\n52:08\\nSounds good.\\n \\nSandi Settle\\n52:10\\nWell, thanks, everybody, for the time we\\'ll see you in a few minutes. I\\'m gonna take a quick break, and then we\\'ll jump on the other. The other call.\\n \\nLynn Dodds\\n52:18\\nI don\\'t think I am.\\n \\n Save & SubmitCancel',\n",

       "  'output': 'Expanding internationally can be a great opportunity for your business. When considering the best city to open your next 10 homes in, you should take into account several factors, such as demand, cost of living, local regulations, and potential competition.\\n\\nBased on these factors, here are five cities to consider for your expansion:\\n\\n1. London, United Kingdom:\\nLondon is a popular destination for international students and interns, with numerous prestigious universities and companies based in the city. The UK generally has a robust legal system and a relatively straightforward process for setting up a business. However, London has a high cost of living, and the competition in the housing market can be fierce.\\n2. Berlin, Germany:\\nBerlin is a thriving city with a growing startup scene, attracting students and interns from around the world. The cost of living in Berlin is lower than in London, and the rental market is more accessible. Germany has well-established regulations for rental properties, and you may need to navigate some bureaucracy when setting up your business.\\n3. Toronto, Canada:\\nToronto is a diverse city with a strong demand for student and intern housing due to its many universities and businesses. The cost of living is relatively high, but Canada has a stable legal system and a favorable environment for startups. Be prepared for competition in the housing market, and research local regulations related to rental properties.\\n4. Barcelona, Spain:\\nBarcelona is an attractive destination for international students and interns due to its pleasant climate, rich culture, and relatively low cost of living. The city has a strong demand for housing, but local regulations may be more challenging to navigate. Be prepared to invest time in understanding Spanish rental laws and business regulations.\\n5. Sydney, Australia:\\nSydney is a popular destination for students and interns, boasting several world-renowned universities and a thriving business scene. The cost of living is high, but the legal framework for businesses is well-established and relatively straightforward. Research local rental regulations and be prepared for competition in the housing market.\\n\\nWhen expanding to a new city, you should consider factors such as the local demand for housing, the cost of living, and the ease of setting up a business. Additionally, keep in mind that local regulations and legal barriers can differ significantly between countries, and it is crucial to understand these differences before committing to a specific location. It is recommended to consult with local legal and real estate experts to help you make the best decision for your business expansion.'},\n",

Set up Google Analytics: If you haven't already set up Google Analytics, you'll need to do so first. Once you have your account set up, you can access the real-time data from the Google Analytics Real-Time API.\\n2. Create an AWS Lambda function: You can use AWS Lambda to retrieve the real-time data from Google Analytics and send it to CloudWatch. Create a new Lambda function in your AWS account and give it the necessary permissions to access the Google Analytics API.\\n3. Configure the Lambda function: In the Lambda function code, use the Google Analytics Real-Time API to retrieve the real-time data for the metric you're interested in (e.g., pageviews, sessions, etc.). Once you have the data, use the AWS CloudWatch PutMetricData API to send the data to CloudWatch.\\n4. Create a CloudWatch dashboard: Once the Lambda function is set up and running, you can create a CloudWatch dashboard to display the real-time data. Choose the metrics you want to display (e.g., pageviews, sessions) and create a graph or other visual representation of the data.\\n5. Schedule the Lambda function: To update the data in real-time, you can schedule the Lambda function to run at regular intervals (e.g., every minute). This will ensure that the CloudWatch dashboard always displays the latest data.\\n\\nWith these steps, you should be able to display the real-time Google Analytics visits data on your AWS CloudWatch dashboard.\"},\n",

       "  'output': \"Yes, it's generally important to remove any old glue or adhesive from the spine before attaching new mull. This is because old adhesive can break down over time and become brittle or discolored, which can interfere with the adhesion of the new mull and weaken the overall structure of the book.\\n\\nTo remove old adhesive from the spine, a conservator or restorer will typically use specialized tools and solvents to gently dissolve and lift the adhesive. This process can be time-consuming and delicate, as the goal is to remove the old adhesive without damaging the spine or the surrounding pages.\\n\\nOnce the old adhesive has been removed, the spine can be prepared for the new mull. This might involve applying a thin layer of adhesive to the spine or to the new mull itself, and then carefully attaching the mull to the spine. The mull is usually smoothed out with a bone folder or other tool to ensure a tight, even bond.\\n\\nBy removing old adhesive and properly attaching new mull to the spine, a conservator or restorer can help to ensure that the book remains stable and intact for years to come.\"},\n",

Embossing: You can use an embossing machine to create a texture on the new cloth that matches the original. You would need to create a custom die that matches the grain pattern and texture of the original cloth, and then run the new cloth through the machine to create the texture.\\n2. Hand tooling: If the original texture is more irregular or complex, you may need to create the texture by hand. You can use a variety of tools and techniques to create texture, such as a bone folder, a texturing hammer, or a sandpaper block. It can take some practice to achieve a natural-looking texture that matches the original.\\n3. Painting or staining: If the texture of the original cloth is relatively subtle, you can try to recreate it by painting or staining the new cloth. You can mix acrylic paint or wood stain with water to create a thin wash, and then apply it to the new cloth with a sponge or brush. You can experiment with different colors and dilution levels to achieve the desired effect.\\n\\nKeep in mind that matching the texture of the original cloth exactly may not be possible, but with some experimentation and creativity, you can create a repair that blends in well with the original book.'},\n",

His unexpected death weakens Cersei's naval power, leaving King's Landing more vulnerable to attack and forcing her to adapt her strategy.\\n* Qyburn: As Cersei's most trusted advisor and the mastermind behind many of her schemes, Qyburn's death is a significant loss for her forces. He is killed by his own creation, the Mountain, when he attempts to intervene during a heated confrontation between the Mountain and Sandor Clegane, the Hound. Qyburn's death disrupts Cersei's plans and leaves her without a vital source of counsel and support.\\n1. On the undead:\\n* Viserion: The Night King's reanimated dragon, Viserion, is unexpectedly killed during a fierce battle in the skies above King's Landing. Drogon, under Daenerys' command, manages to deliver a fatal blow to the undead dragon, plunging it into the sea. Viserion's death weakens the Night King's aerial advantage and further galvanizes the living forces.\\n* A White Walker Lieutenant: In a surprising turn of events, Jaime Lannister sacrifices himself to kill a powerful White Walker lieutenant, saving Brienne of Tarth from certain death. Jaime's actions cause the wights under the lieutenant's control to collapse, providing a brief reprieve for the living forces. His selfless act helps to change the tide of the battle and marks his redemption in the eyes of many.\\n\\nThese unexpected and key deaths have a profound impact on the conflict, shaping the strategies and morale of each side. The sacrifices of these characters serve as a testament to the high stakes of the battle and the determination of all involved to secure a better future for Westeros.\"},\n",

       "  'output': \"Apologies for the confusion in my previous responses. I realize now that there was a discrepancy between the different storylines I had presented. To clarify, let's consider this alternate ending:\\n\\nAfter the final conflict, Daenerys, having witnessed the devastation caused by her dragon and realizing the destructive potential of her quest for power, decides to step away from her pursuit of the Iron Throne. She chooses instead to focus on using her remaining dragon, Drogon, to help rebuild Westeros and promote unity among the Seven Kingdoms.\\n\\nIn this scenario, Daenerys becomes an advisor to the newly formed council of representatives from the Great Houses. Her experience, wisdom, and connection to Drogon prove invaluable in establishing a more peaceful and prosperous realm.\\n\\nAs for the future of dragons, the possibilities remain similar to those mentioned earlier:\\n\\n1. Hidden Dragon Eggs: Undiscovered dragon eggs could still be hidden throughout the world, waiting to be found and hatched.\\n2. Dragon Survival: Drogon's survival, with Daenerys as his caretaker, indicates that dragons may continue to exist in the world, though their role will likely change as Westeros moves towards a more balanced and peaceful era.\\n3. Dragon Legacy: The knowledge and history of dragons will live on through Daenerys and the other characters who have experienced their power firsthand, inspiring future generations to rediscover the magical creatures.\\n\\nThese possibilities leave the future of dragons in Westeros open to interpretation and offer ample material for potential spin-offs and follow-up franchises.\"},\n",

Lustick is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of Paradigm Lost: From Two-State Solution to One-State Reality.\\n\\nPundits warn that civil war may be coming to Israel. In fact, civil war has already arrived. In just the first 10 weeks of this year, bloody violence in all parts of the country has resulted in nearly a hundred dead and thousands wounded, along with waves of mass civil disobedience and a looming constitutional crisis. All this follows an unprecedentedly tumultuous period in Israeli politics—five indecisive elections in just four years.\\n\\nBut what, exactly, is this war being fought over?\\n\\nAsk hundreds of thousands of protesters opposing the government’s legislative blitz against the judiciary and they will say it is over whether Israel will remain a democracy or become a dictatorship run by ultranationalists, racists, and fundamentalists.\\n\\nAsk government officials and they will say it is over whether Israel will be ruled democratically, by the will of the majority of voters, or whether an elite-controlled deep state, protected by weaponized courts, will ride roughshod over the people’s will.\\n\\nAsk Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and they will say it is over whether the nightmare they are living can be made to include Israeli Jews or whether masses of Arab non-citizens can be bludgeoned into political irrelevance.\\n\\nAsk rampaging Jewish settlers and they will say it is over whether a Supreme Court of unbelievers can use foreign ideas to keep Jews from settling and redeeming their land.\\nWhat is most striking is that although both sides say they are fighting for democracy, no one will publicly acknowledge what this struggle is actually about. Much like white northern elites in the United States during the 1850s who didn’t see that the brewing conflict was fundamentally about equal citizenship rights, few in today’s Israel acknowledge what is at stake in the Israeli context: namely, whether Palestinians will someday be equal citizens of the state in which they live.\\n\\nPalestinians burn tires during a protest near the Israel-Gaza border east of the Jabalia refugee camp.\\nPalestinians burn tires during a protest near the Israel-Gaza border east of the Jabalia refugee camp.\\nPalestinians burn tires during a protest near the Israel-Gaza border east of the Jabalia refugee camp on Feb. 23.MAHMUD HAMS/AFP VIA GETTY IMAGES\\nThere is a good deal of hullabaloo about whether the Jewish state will remain, become, or stop being a genuine democracy, but virtually no discussion of the impossibility of it being both a Jewish state and a democracy when half the country’s inhabitants are Palestinian Arabs.\\n\\nApproximately 6.8 million Palestinian Arabs live under the actual if not formally declared rule of the government of Israel. If half a million non-Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union are taken into account, this means there are more Arabs living in Israel than there are Jews.\\n\\nSo what is at stake is not just whether Israel is or will be a democracy (or can get away with calling itself a democracy even if it is not). What is at stake, really, is whether a regime of Jewish supremacy will be established so that the full weight of the state’s laws can be explicitly used to enforce the disenfranchisement and subjugation of half the population.\\n\\nIndeed, to sustain itself and protect against Jewish-Arab alliances that could end the racist regime it aims to create, the government will need to not only outlaw Arab participation in politics but also ban activity by Jews that might lead to Arab emancipation. That is why, if the Supreme Court of Israel is successfully neutered, the present government will move to outlaw anti-Zionist (i.e., Arab) parties as just another step toward the eventual exclusion of all Palestinians from political life.\\n\\nTo protect against Jewish-Arab alliances that could end the racist regime it aims to create, the government will need to not only outlaw Arab political participation but also ban activity by Jews that might lead to Arab emancipation.\\n\\nOf course, some Israelis know very well what they are fighting for, however reluctant they may be to say so out loud. Among them are Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich (who is also, within the Defense Ministry, in charge of civilian affairs in Judea and Samaria) and the settlers, fundamentalist ideologues, and ultranationalist activists he represents. With one another they are candid about their aims, but occasionally they let the cat out of the bag in public, as Smotrich did with his comment about needing to “erase” the Palestinian town of Hawara.\\n\\nA slice of the Israeli Jewish left also knows what is really at stake, having come to understand that the rights of secular liberal Jews, and their hope to live in a country they can experience as sane, are increasingly dependent on Arab political mobilization and Arab votes. The intellectual elite among West Bank and Gaza Palestinians also know that, in the long run, political equality is the fundamental question that will determine their future.\\n\\nBut none of these groups will speak the truth. Smotrich and his followers prefer not to contradict their claim to be democrats by talking about their plans for the permanent political enslavement of Israel’s Palestinians. Leftists fear that speaking of Arab rights, or including Arabs and Palestinian flags in demonstrations, will damage prospects for a protest movement that currently presents itself as a carnival of blue-and-white patriotic Zionists. And Palestinians who aspire to eventually live in a state that represents all its citizens, whether named Israel or Israel-Palestine, cannot admit to this for fear of retribution from either the Palestinian Authority (committed officially to the now-defunct vision of a separate Palestinian state) or the “resistance”-oriented street, which is intolerant of programs requiring decades of political mobilization.\\n\\nTens of thousands of Israelis hold umbrellas and wave flags during a demonstration to protest the right-wing government's plan to weaken the authority of the Supreme Court.\\nTens of thousands of Israelis hold umbrellas and wave flags during a demonstration to protest the right-wing government's plan to weaken the authority of the Supreme Court.\\nTens of thousands of Israelis hold umbrellas and wave flags during a demonstration at Habima Square in Tel Aviv, Israel, on Jan. 14, as they protest the right-wing government’s plan to weaken the authority of the Supreme Court.EYAL WARSHAVSKY/SOPA IMAGES/LIGHTROCKET VIA GETTY IMAGES\\nMost Israelis, however, do not feel the reality of what this struggle is about. On the right, they are focused on specific opportunities the government’s judicial “reforms” open for expanding settlements, ending protections for Arab citizens, increasing ultra-Orthodox subsidies, guaranteeing freedom of ultra-Orthodox men from military service, and expanding religious authority over both personal and public life. Accustomed to viewing Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as outside their state, even while living within the domain of its power, they view the Arab problem “through the gunsights” (as the Hebrew expression goes) and see the regime they live in, which privileges Jews over non-Jews, as an unchangeable given in their lives.\\n\\nIn the center and center-left, things are more complex. In Israel, 20 percent of the population, mostly secular Jewish Israelis, pay 80 percent of the taxes. They dominate the high-tech industry and the most sophisticated domains of the Israeli military. By contrast, 150,000 ultra-Orthodox men receive stipends for full-time study of Jewish texts. Less than half of all ultra-Orthodox men ever enter the workforce, and many of those who do hold state-funded, economically unproductive positions as religious functionaries. This will not change anytime soon.\\n\\nSixty percent of ultra-Orthodox high school students are given no access to courses in math, science, or English. Only a tiny number serve in the army. Meanwhile, middle- and upper-middle-class secular Israeli Jews—living along the coast, in moshav and kibbutz gated communities, and in some posh Jerusalem neighborhoods—are outraged by their treatment as useful idiots and cannon fodder for corrupt right-wing politicians, wild-eyed settlers, and unreconstructed 17th-century rabbis.\\n\\nIn American parlance, Israel is now a deeply red state. From something like Ohio or Pennsylvania in the 1980s, Israel has become Oklahoma or Idaho.\\n\\nThat outrage brings them into the streets, but it is not enough to end the story they tell about themselves: the story of how good Jews can make Israel a cozy, liberal, and democratic country, without allying with Palestinians.\",\n",

In the mid-1990s equal numbers of Israeli Jews identified themselves as right-wing and left-wing. In a typical 2022 poll, 62 percent of Israeli Jews identified themselves with the right, compared to just 11 percent who identified with the left. The nationalist, social-democratically oriented Labor Party has performed dismally in recent elections.

What is at stake, ultimately, is not only the character of the regime—liberal democratic versus ethnocratic authoritarian—but also the fundamental character of the state ruled by that regime.\\n\\nThinking about this crisis as one of identity as well as rights means considering a comparable historical case, in which a country faced civil war over laws that could not be tolerated by half its citizenry—an issue that could only be resolved by transforming fundamental beliefs about what the country was and who belonged in it.\\n\\nIn 1858, Abraham Lincoln—then a candidate for the Senate—spoke against the continuing insistence by slave states that slavery be extended to Kansas, Nebraska, and other western territories. Warning of a necessary crisis before the problem would be solved, Lincoln said: “A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free. … It will become all one thing, or all the other.”\\n\\nLincoln was speaking of a war he saw coming, a war over whether the United States would be a country in which slavery would eventually be extinguished or a country forever and everywhere marked by enslavement and policies of oppression—policies directed against freed Blacks, of course, but also, eventually, against abolitionist whites.\\n\\nInstructively, it was the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Dred Scott case, that Congress had no authority to ban slavery in some parts of the country, that led to a civil war that ended with the banning of slavery in all parts of the country.\\n\\nIt was the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision that Congress had no authority to ban slavery in some parts of the country that led to a civil war that ended with the banning of slavery in all parts of the country.\\n\\nOne in 10 Israeli Jews now lives across the 1949 armistice lines that used to demarcate the border of the state of Israel—a boundary no longer registered by official maps of the country. In the single state that now exists between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, all inhabitants—whether they live in the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria, the Jordan Valley, the Golan Heights, expanded East Jerusalem, or within the 1949 armistice lines—are subject to the decisions of the same government.\\n\\nIn each of these areas, different groups suffer from or enjoy the protection of laws, the effects of policies, and the assistance or consequences of police actions passed, promulgated, and ordered by the same government. If these circumstances are understood for the one-state reality they represent, Lincoln’s analysis can be seen to illuminate Israel’s future today as clearly as it did the future of the United States in the late 1850s.\\n\\nWhen civil war first erupted in the United States, few talked of the struggle as being about whether the vast population of stigmatized Black non-citizens would eventually enjoy the same political rights as the white population. Even Lincoln himself spoke of miscegenation as the great threat and of returning freed slaves to Africa as the solution to the nation’s racial problem. We therefore should not expect the real political stakes of a struggle as fundamental as that faced by the United States in the 1850s or by Israel now to be framed explicitly by the contending sides.\\n\\nWhat we should expect, however, is that crises that shake and change and destroy regimes can also transform thinking about what a country is, who its rightful inhabitants are, and which identities will be privileged, stigmatized, or honored. The United States’ bloody 1860s were the beginning of generations of change that proved Lincoln correct.\\n\\nOnce U.S. slavery was ended, Jim Crow took its place; but vigilante violence, prejudice, and persecution could not keep democratic politics from eventually opening opportunities for political emancipation and the alliances enabled by it. The Democratic Party, raised on racism and anchored in segregation and southern exclusion of Black Americans from political life, ended up finding electoral salvation in an alliance with Black people and other minorities, uniting with a vision of the country that its political ancestors would have abhorred—had they even been capable of imagining it.\\n\\nThat is the magic of democratic politics, of the onetime arch-segregationist George Wallace winning his fourth term as governor of Alabama in 1982 by kissing Black babies. The result of this long process of struggle, value change, and political realignment was a multicultural, multiracial liberal democracy—flawed, but intact and a world away from what the regime was when Lincoln spoke.\\n\\nThough unable to speak its own deepest truth, the current Israeli government is committed, above all, to Jewish supremacy and to the transformation of the very partially liberal, not wholly democratic regime that has existed for 75 years into one capable of permanently excluding half the state’s population from the exercise of political rights.\\n\\nJewish protesters against the Netanyahu government’s attempted legal putsch are committed, above all, to the protection of their property and prerogatives as Israeli citizens. Not being Arabs, they benefit from the facade of egalitarian liberalism associated with Israel’s self-presentation as a Jewish and democratic state.\\n\\nAnti-government demonstrators are unwilling to acknowledge that they cannot win a struggle to make Israel a liberal democracy without forming an alliance with a fully enfranchised Palestinian population.\\n\\nThe government and its allies are unwilling to declare that an apartheid-style regime, based on explicit, systematic discrimination in favor of Jews, is exactly what the country needs to manage the absorption of the West Bank and Gaza they desire.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the anti-government demonstrators—still dangerously attached to the idea of a Jewish state and the two-state solution mirage that protects it—are unwilling to acknowledge that they cannot win a struggle to make Israel a liberal democracy without forming an alliance with a large, fully enfranchised, and highly mobilized Palestinian population.\\n\\nPerhaps the most likely outcome of the current crisis is a reformulation of the judicial reforms sufficient to quiet the protests without bringing on the immediate fall of the government. Such an outcome may result in a temporary political cease-fire.\\n\\nBut as bloodshed, raids, pogroms, rocket attacks, and reprisals associated with Israeli domination of the West Bank and Gaza escalate, the deeper crisis will continue.\\n\\nWhen, eventually, masses of Jewish protesters demand equal rights for Palestinians, partly because they will no longer be able to protect their own rights without Palestinian help, then we will know that the decisive battle has begun.',\n",

       " {'instruction': 'S:\\nJERUSALEM (AP) — Tens of thousands of Israelis demonstrated outside parliament and workers launched a nationwide strike Monday in a dramatic escalation of the mass protest movement aimed at halting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s plan to overhaul the judiciary.\\n\\nBut as Netanyahu remained silent, signs emerged that he would soon delay the divisive program. His national security minister, Itamar Ben-Gvir, announced late Monday that the plan was being put on hold until the parliament’s summer session, which begins on April 30, giving time for the rival sides to seek a compromise.\\n\\nThe chaos shut down much of the country and threatened to paralyze the economy. Departing flights from the main international airport were grounded. Large mall chains and universities closed their doors, and Israel’s largest trade union called for its 800,000 members to stop work in health care, transit, banking and other fields.\\n\\nDiplomats walked off the job at foreign missions, and local governments were expected to close preschools and cut other services. The main doctors union announced that its members would also strike.\\n\\nThe growing resistance to Netanyahu’s plan came hours after tens of thousands of people burst into the streets around the country in a spontaneous show of anger at the prime minister’s decision to fire his defense minister after he called for a pause to the overhaul. Chanting “the country is on fire,” they lit bonfires on Tel Aviv’s main highway, closing the thoroughfare and many others throughout the country for hours.\\n\\nMORE COVERAGE\\n– Israeli defense minister calls for halt to judicial overhaul\\n– How Netanyahu judicial plan sparked massive unrest in Israel\\nDemonstrators gathered again Monday outside the Knesset, or parliament, turning the streets surrounding the building and the Supreme Court into a roiling sea of blue-and-white Israeli flags dotted with rainbow Pride banners. Large demonstrations in Tel Aviv, Haifa and other cities drew thousands more.\\n\\n“This is the last chance to stop this move into a dictatorship,” said Matityahu Sperber, 68, who joined a stream of people headed to the protest outside the Knesset. “I’m here for the fight to the end.”\\n\\nIt was unclear how Netanyahu would respond to the growing pressure. Some members of his Likud party said they would support the prime minister if he heeded calls to halt the overhaul. Israeli media, citing unnamed sources, reported that he could indeed pause it.\\n\\nBen-Gvir, who has been one of the strongest proponents of the plan, announced after meeting with the prime minister that he had agreed to a delay of at least a few weeks.\\n\\nHe said Netanyahu had agreed to bring the legislation for a vote when parliament reconvenes “if no agreements are reached during the recess.”\\n\\nNetanyahu was expected to speak to the nation later Monday.\\n\\nThe plan — driven by Netanyahu, who is on trial for corruption, and his allies in Israel’s most right-wing government ever — has plunged Israel into one of its worst domestic crises. It has sparked sustained protests that have galvanized nearly all sectors of society, including its military, where reservists have increasingly said publicly that they will not serve a country veering toward autocracy.\\n\\nIsrael’s Palestinian citizens, however, have largely sat out the protests. Many say Israel’s democracy is tarnished by its military rule over their brethren in the West Bank and the discrimination they themselves face.\\n\\nThe turmoil has magnified longstanding and intractable differences over Israel’s character that have riven it since the country was founded. Protesters insist they are fighting for the soul of the nation, saying the overhaul will remove Israel’s system of checks and balances and directly challenge its democratic ideals.\\n\\nThe government has labeled them anarchists out to topple democratically elected leaders. Government officials say the plan will restore balance between the judicial and executive branches and rein in what they see as an interventionist court with liberal sympathies.\\n\\nAt the center of the crisis is Netanyahu himself, Israel’s longest-serving leader, and questions about the lengths he may be willing to go to maintain his grip on power, even as he battles charges of fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in three separate affairs. He denies wrongdoing.\\n\\nOn Monday afternoon, Netanyahu issued his first statement since he fired Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, urging against violence ahead of a planned counterprotest in Jerusalem organized by ultranationalist supporters of the judicial overhaul.\\n\\nThe counterprotest was also slated to take place outside parliament. “They won’t steal the election from us,” read a flyer for event, organized by Religious Zionist party.\\n\\n“I call on all protesters in Jerusalem, right and left, to behave responsibly and not act violently,” Netanyahu wrote on Twitter.\\n\\nThe firing of Netanyahu’s defense minister at a time of heightened security threats in the West Bank and elsewhere, appeared to be a last straw for many, including apparently the Histadrut, the country’s largest trade union umbrella group, which sat out the monthslong protests before the defense minister’s firing.\\n\\n“Where are we leading our beloved Israel? To the abyss,” Arnon Bar-David, the group’s head, said in a rousing speech to applause. “Today we are stopping everyone’s descent toward the abyss.”\\n\\nOn Monday, as the embers of the highway bonfires were cleared, Israel’s ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, called again for an immediate halt to the overhaul.\\n\\n“The entire nation is rapt with deep worry. Our security, economy, society — all are under threat,” he said. “Wake up now!”\\n\\nOpposition leader Yair Lapid said the crisis was driving Israel to the brink.\\n\\n“We’ve never been closer to falling apart. Our national security is at risk, our economy is crumbling, our foreign relations are at their lowest point ever. We don’t know what to say to our children about their future in this country,” Lapid said.\\n\\nThe developments were being watched by the Biden administration, which is closely allied with Israel yet has been uneasy with Netanyahu and the far-right elements of his government. National Security Council spokesperson Adrienne Watson said the United States was “deeply concerned” by the developments.\\n\\nNetanyahu reportedly spent the night in consultations and was set to speak to the nation, but later delayed his speech.\\n\\nThe architect of the plan, Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a popular party member, had long promised he would resign if the overhaul was suspended. But on Monday, he said he would respect the prime minister’s decision should he halt the legislation.\\n\\nEarlier, Netanyahu’s hard-line allies pressed him to continue.\\n\\n“We must not halt the reform in the judicial system, and we must not give in to anarchy,” Ben-Gvir said.\\n\\nNetanyahu’s dismissal of Gallant appeared to signal that the prime minister and his allies would barrel ahead. Gallant was the first senior member of the ruling Likud party to speak out against the plan, saying the deep divisions threatened to weaken the military.\\n\\nAnd Netanyahu’s government forged ahead with a centerpiece of the overhaul — a law that would give the governing coalition the final say over all judicial appointments. A parliamentary committee approved the legislation on Monday for a final vote, which could come this week.\\n\\nThe government also seeks to pass laws that would would grant the Knesset the authority to overturn Supreme Court decisions and limit judicial review of laws.\\n\\nA separate law that would circumvent a Supreme Court ruling to allow a key coalition ally to serve as minister was delayed following a request from that party’s leader.\\n\\nNetanyahu returned to power late last year after a protracted political crisis that sent Israelis to the polls five times in less than four years.

The government also contends the Supreme Court is not representative of the diversity of Israeli society.\\n\\nIn its proposed judicial changes, the government is first trying to change the makeup of a nine-member committee that selects judges for the court. The proposal would give representatives and appointees of the government an automatic majority on the committee, effectively allowing the government to choose the judges.

They also fear that Mr. Netanyahu, who is standing trial on corruption charges, could use the changes to extricate himself from his legal troubles.\\n\\nThe Judicial Crisis in Israel\\nComplicated Ties: As Israel's government pushes ahead with its plan to overhaul the judiciary, the resulting crisis has shown the limits of President Biden’s influence on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\nMilitary Concerns: The proposed overhaul has prompted many Israeli reservists to avoid volunteer duty. Military leaders have privately warned that this might require scaling back operations.\\nFueling the Overhaul: The Kohelet Policy Forum has been a major force behind the judicial overhaul, but who's behind the once-obscure think tank? Two guys from Queens.\\nA Grass-Roots Movement: The protests across Israel against the government’s plan, both large and small, often spread by word of mouth and WhatsApp messaging groups.\\nWhy is the country divided?\\nIn broad terms, the schism in Israeli society has divided people into two groups: those who want a more secular and pluralist state and those with a more religious and nationalist vision.\\n\\nTo its critics, the Supreme Court is seen as the last bastion of the secular, centrist elite descended from European Jewry who dominated the state during its earliest decades. Religious Jews, particularly the ultra-Orthodox, perceive the court as an obstacle to their way of life.\\n\\nThe court has often opposed certain privileges and financial subsidies for the ultra-Orthodox. In particular, the court rejected a special dispensation that allowed ultra-Orthodox Jews to postpone military service in favor of religious study, infuriating religious leaders. Right-wing Israelis who want to entrench Israeli settlement in the occupied West Bank also see the court as an antagonist.\\n\\nWho is protesting?\\nThe opposition has mainly been driven by secular centrists who fear the overhaul will threaten their freedoms and way of life. But there is also a growing resistance and desire for dialogue and compromise from parts of the religious right who say the government has pushed too far and too fast.\\n\\nIsrael’s largest trade union, which had previously tried to stay out of the fray, appeared to be on the verge of calling for a general strike on Monday, with a speech by its leader planned for late morning.\\n\\nThe heads of Israel’s leading universities collectively announced they would indefinitely shut their doors to protest the plan, starting Monday morning.\\n\\nBut perhaps the most consequential opposition to the process has come from military reservists, who play a significant role in Israel’s military capacity.\\n\\nImage\\nA man in a blue suit and tie stands behind a microphone, with a flag behind him. \\nYoav Gallant, who was fired as defense minister on Sunday.Credit...Gil Cohen-Magen/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images\\n\\nReservists say they fear being given illegal military orders if the Supreme Court lacks the power to scrutinize government activity adequately. And they fear being charged in international courts if the Israeli justice system is perceived as being too weak to prosecute soldiers.\\n\\nMilitary leaders have warned that a decline in reservists, who form a key part of the air force pilot corps, might soon affect the military’s operational capacity. The defense minister, Yoav Gallant, called on Saturday for a halt to the judicial changes; he was fired on Sunday by Mr. Netanyahu, whose office announced the dismissal in a one-line statement.\\n\\nBut worries persist among military leaders, who have privately said they worry that full-time soldiers may also begin to resign. On Sunday, the military chief of staff, Herzi Halevi, ordered all commanders to speak with their subordinates about the need to keep politics out of the military and maintain cohesion, military officials said.\\n\\nWhat happens next?\\nThe government had planned a final vote in Parliament early this week on the first part of the overhaul, the ability to pick Supreme Court judges. But after Sunday’s protests, it is unclear whether Mr. Netanyahu will go along with the hard-line members of his coalition and push through a vote. Mr. Netanyahu was said to be considering a pause in the program, but the hard-line members proceeded on Monday morning with the parliamentary measures needed to prepare the bill for a vote.\\n\\nImage\\nWater from a water cannon is fired at protesters, some of whom are holding Israeli flags. \\nA water cannon being used against protesters on Monday in Tel Aviv.

       " {'instruction': 'S:\\nThe proposed changes\\nJudicial selection\\nCurrent system\\nThe Judicial Selection Committee is composed of nine members. Three of them are Supreme Court judges, two are representatives of the Bar Association, two are Knesset members and two are ministers.[26] Selection of judges to all courts require a simple majority of the Committee, but selection of Supreme Court judges require the approval of 7 out of the 9 members on the Committee, granting essentially veto powers to either the three judges or the representatives of the ruling Parliamentary coalition. According to the Israel Democracy Institute, the effect of the current system is one of consensus, in that \"the selection of Supreme Court justices has mandated the consent of the politicians on the [Committee], because a majority of seven of its nine members must support a successful candidate. By the same token, the politicians cannot select judges without the agreement of the justices on the committee. This principle has generally produced a consensus on a slate of new justices.\"[27] In contrast, those who view the current Supreme Court as left-leaning, including Minister of Justice Yariv Levin and Prime Minister Netanyahu, state that this \\'consensus\\' is one-sided: When a right-wing government is in place, its members must compromise with the allegedly left-leaning committee members (the 3 Supreme Court justices and the Bar representatives who, it is claimed by Levin, vote as a block), but when a left-wing government is in charge, supposedly no such consensus is needed. They point to the recent appointment of 61 judges in one sitting of the committee, under the previous center-left government, with no effective way for the opposition to object.[28][29][30]\\n\\nProposed system\\nAccording to the amendments proposed to the Judiciary Basic Law by Justice Minister, Yariv Levin, the Judicial Selection Committee\\'s composition will be changed to give greater weight to the legislative and executive branches of government. The Committee will consist of eleven members, namely the Minister of Justice who will serve as the Committee Chairman, two Ministers designated by the government, the Chairman of the Knesset Constitution, Law and Justice Committee, the Chairman of the Knesset State Control Committee, the Chairman of the Knesset Committee, the President of the Supreme Court, two other judges of the Supreme Court who will be chosen from their fellow judges, and two public representatives chosen by the Minister of Justice, one of them being a lawyer.[31] As a result, since the committee chairmen are usually (though not always) selected from the ranks of the ruling coalition, the government could have complete control over the appointment and dismissal of judges, with seven representatives on the Committee out of eleven members in total.\\n\\nArguments in favor of the reform\\nArguments put forward to justify this change include the following:\\n\\nAs things stand, members who are not publicly elected officials — the judges and lawyers — have a majority in the Committee, and it is impossible to appoint a judge of whom they do not approve to any judicature. Furthermore, it is alleged that the Supreme Court\\'s representatives generally vote in a coordinated manner, and this causes the judiciary\\'s representatives to negotiate with the other Committee members as one unit, with increased negotiating power.[31]\\nComparatively, focusing exclusively on the Supreme Court, Israeli judicial selection is exceptional when contrasted with other democratic countries. A 2019 study of judicial appointments to constitutional courts of the 36 OECD countries (supreme courts or constitutional courts) found that 24 out of 36 countries surveyed appoint their judges in a system that grants the power to elected officials exclusively.[32] For example, in the United States, supreme court judges are appointed by the president, with the confirmation of the Senate; in Germany, constitutional court judges are appointed by both chambers of the legislature; in France, the judges of the constitutional council are appointed by the President and both houses of representatives in equal proportion, and alongside them serve former state presidents; in Japan, the selection is controlled by the government subject to ratification through a referendum. This system of exclusive appointment of judges by the elected officials is common to Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Switzerland, Austria, Ireland, the Netherlands, Denmark, Sweden, Iceland, Finland, Norway and more. It must be stated that in Israel, such a system was used during the state\\'s early years and that the judges that established the Supreme Court were appointed by the government with the Knesset\\'s approval.\\nOnly four OECD member states, besides Israel, appoint their constitutional court judges without giving the elected officials the ability to appoint the judges: Turkey, Greece, the UK and Luxembourg. However, the UK and Luxembourg are distinct from Israel and most other states in that their judges cannot void parliament\\'s laws, and that the supremacy of the public\\'s values are attained by legislative supremacy. From this, of the 36 OECD countries, Israel\\'s sole companions in giving a veto to non-elected officials over judicial appointed to the highest tribunal authorized to strike down parliament\\'s laws, are Greece and Turkey.[33][32]\\nOf the 50 states that comprise the United States, in 22 states, the supreme court judges are elected directly by voting ballot; in another 15 states, the appointments are ratified in a direct vote; four states elect their judges through the public officials and eight states appoint by committees in which the majority of the members are appointed by elected officials.[32]\\nArguments against the reform\\nThe Kohelet Policy Forum study[32] used to underpin most of the above arguments has been strongly criticized as being selective in its reliance on foreign legal systems. For example:\\n\\nWhile 31 of the 36 countries in the study have public representatives selecting the judges, in 24 of them, judges are selected in consultation with the judicial system and upon its recommendation.\\nFurther, while in most of these countries such a recommendation carries no legal force, in practice it is binding, as the public representatives listen to the judges\\' recommendations and act upon them. As noted in a study, \"the political culture in these countries is such that public representatives select the judges with the consent and blessing of the judicial system — a political culture completely different than that in Israel.\"[34]\\nThe same study notes: \"The other developed countries, in which there is no appreciable involvement of the justice system in judicial selection, are almost all countries with constitutions. Some have a federal structure of several states, each with its own additional supreme court protecting the residents of that federal state. Most have bicameral legislatures not necessarily controlled by the party controlling the executive branch, and so the government\\'s power is decentralized. Usually judicial selection requires the consent of the government as well as both houses of parliament, and almost always the choice in the legislative chambers requires a large majority (usually two thirds of the votes, and even an absolute majority). In other words, the coalition, which does not rule alone and cannot appoint judges on its own, needs the consent of the opposition as well. None of this exists in Israel, and that completely changes the picture.\"[35]\\nThe proposed changes would also grant the government complete control in appointing judges to all courts other than the Supreme Court. The justification for changing the manner of appointing judges to courts other than the Supreme Court is unclear.\\nIn addition, the Knesset\\'s Research Unit,[36] in a survey, also presented a very different picture, quoting an OECD report[37] arguing that on the purposes promoted by most democracies is to prevent any single power control over judicial appointment of constitutional court justices.\\n\\nThe Israeli Law Professors Forum for Democracy, comprising over 100 legal experts and academics in Israel,[38] has published a number of position papers analyzing these reforms, concluding that their implementation would undermine the judiciary\\'s \"independence, subordinate the judiciary to the elected government, and render the separation of powers in Israel an empty shell\".[39]\\n\\nAccording to Prof. Elise Brezis, director of the Azrieli Center for Economic Policy at Bar-Ilan University, the Kohelet Policy Forum did not attempt to assess the impact their plan will have on the Israeli economy. She compared the plan to a \"pretty architectural sketch with no engineering assessment.\"[40]',\n",

       " {'instruction': 'S:\\nGovernment legal advisors\\nThe coalition has published a draft bill to reclassify ministry legal advisers from independent authorities to politically selected counsel whose opinions are explicitly non-binding upon the government and its ministers. The draft bill determines that \"legal advice given to the government\" or to \"the prime minister and all government ministers, will not obligate it or be able to alter its legal position\", and that the cabinet and its ministers are \"authorized to reject legal advice and operate against it.\" This would substantially change the system which has been in place till today, whereby each ministry\\'s legal adviser falls under the aegis of the Attorney General to preserve their independence from political influence, and their advice is binding upon ministries.[41]\\n\\nThe immediate former Attorney General, Avichai Mendelblit, has formerly criticized past attempts to pass such laws, stating that \"letting ministers appoint legal advisers — instead of the current system of election through public tender — would politicize the position and harm the integrity of Israeli democracy\\'s \\'gatekeepers.\\'\"[12]\\n\\nProf. Yedidia Stern, former dean of the Law Faculty at Bar-Ilan University, has criticized the bill, explaining that a public legal advisor has duties to both \"the government ministry to which he is appointed, and the public. In addition to legal advice, an attorney in the public service is also responsible for safeguarding the rule of law, for the benefit of us all. This dual role justifies dual input — by the minister and by the Attorney General — in the selection of ministry legal advisors.\"[42]\\n\\nDr. Guy Lurie, of the Israel Democracy Institute, has argued that \"In order to safeguard the legality of government actions and prevent corruption, the legal advisors must be independent when issuing their legal opinions, and professionally subordinate to the Attorney General, rather than to the minister.\"[43]\\n\\nConstitutional review\\nThe reform proposes to codify the Supreme Court\\'s power of judicial review, which to date has not been set in legislation. In the face of the absence of such legislation, following the 1992 passing of the Human Dignity and Liberty Basic Law the Supreme Court has delineated such power to itself, including in a landmark decision, the 1995 Mizrahi Bank decision, similar to the US Supreme Court\\'s 1803 decision in Marbury v. Madison.\\n\\nThe bill approved by the Constitution, Law and Justice Committee on 13 February 2023, explicitly states \"the non-justiciability of basic laws, stipulating that a [court] holding adjudication power by law, including the Supreme Court, will not address, directly or indirectly, a question regarding the validity of a basic law, and no ruling on such a matter will be valid.\"[44]\\n\\nThe government has also proposed that if the Knesset passes a regular law that contradicts existing Basic Laws, it will not be considered automatically void, and only the Supreme Court, with a full quorum of all its judges (excluding those precluded from participating for over 30 days from the day that the matter is to be decided) can preside over the law\\'s nullification. Proponents of the change argue that this is in order to guarantee a comprehensive discussion with the full range of views in the Supreme Court, as well as to prevent the discussion from being influenced by the supposed haphazard nature of the panel. It is further proposed that the majority needed to nullify a law is a majority of eighty percent of the total judges, with the argument being that the nullification of a law passed by an elected government should be exceptional (even if it contradicts existing Basic Laws), and if several judges do not decide to nullify the newer contradicting law, the will of the elected government should prevail.\\n\\nThe proposed legislation argues that as the Basic Laws are Israel\\'s supreme legal norms, the Court derives its power of judicial review from the Basic Laws themselves and thus cannot review or strike down the Basic Laws themselves. The proposal seeks to deny judicial review over Basic Laws, in order to guarantee the Supreme Court\\'s subjection to the rule of name and to the source of democratic authority.\\n\\nProponents of this change argue that this is similar to the majority of Western countries in which there is no judicial review over constitutional norms.[31] The legal advisor to the Committee through which this reform is being progressed published an opinion stating he had found no precedent in any democratic country for judicial review over legislation to require a unanimous decision of every judge on the relevant court.[45]\\n\\nOverride clause\\nAnother proposal is to allow the Knesset to reject the interpretation given by the Supreme Court to a Basic Law and to override a Supreme Court decision nullifying a law. According to the proposal, the Knesset will be able to, under specific conditions, override a judicial decision nullifying a law. Proponents argue that the proposed override clause is not to exempt the Knesset from its commitments to constitutional values, but rather to give the legislators the ability to decide differently than the court.\\n\\nIn one form of the proposal, it is proposed that should the Supreme Court nullify a law in full consensus of all judges, the Knesset shall not be able to pass an override law during its term. However, if the Supreme Court decision nullifying primary legislation was not taken in full consensus, it is proposed to allow the Knesset to override the Supreme Court decision nullifying the law with a majority of 61 Knesset members, as long as the law states explicitly that the law will be valid notwithstanding the Supreme Court\\'s ruling. The override will remain valid for the term of the next Knesset, which may review it anew. As such, it is stated that the force of the override is limited to four years or until the end of the first year of the term of a new Knesset after the Knesset that passed the override law, according to the later event. This override model, in which there is no a priori override, allows a proper and useful dialogue between the branches, and for the Knesset to see the Court\\'s detailed ruling before taking the exceptional step of override.\\n\\nIt is further proposed that the Knesset will be able to override the judgement to nullify a law given in full consensus. However, this is on condition that the Knesset that passes the override is a different Knesset than that which passed the nullified law, therefore expressing two Knessets\\' support for a different value framework than that of the Supreme Court. The fact that the public expresses its positions by means of general selections, that the matter pertains to a value judgement of two Knesset and that the negative incentive of immediate legislation is eliminated, justifies returning the final decision to the people and its representatives. In such a case, as well as in a case when a regular override is passed by two Knessets, the override will be permanent.[31]\\n\\nProponents argue that similar clauses exist in Canada, Finland and the Australian state of Victoria.[46] However, studies have pointed out the differences between Israel\\'s system and these countries which affect the impact of such clauses on the political system. For example, a study conducted by Dr. Amichai Cohen of 66 democracies to identify and analyze the structural-formal restraints placed on the political branch concluded that \"without granting the judicial branch the authority to oversee the other branches, Israel will become the sole democracy of significant size in which one elected authority wields practically unlimited power.\"[47]\\n\\nThis proposal has been criticized for giving too much power to the Knesset, far beyond the power wielded by other executive and legislature bodies in Western countries. For example, the Israel Democracy Institute has stated that an \"override clause would give a Knesset majority absolute power to enact laws, notwithstanding the stipulations of the Basic Laws. By doing so, it would severely curtail the Supreme Court\\'s authority of constitutional review of laws passed by the Knesset, which is controlled by the Government (the executive branch) that enjoys a political majority. Every country has checks and balances that set limits on the power of the political majority. In Israel, however, the Supreme Court is the sole balancing mechanism.\"[48]',\n",

       " {'instruction': 'S:\\nAbolition of \"unreasonableness\" grounds\\nArguments in favor of the reform\\nThe reform will abolish the use of \"unreasonableness\" as grounds for review of administrative decisions. Although unreasonablness has its origins in British jurisprudence, the court has expanded on this doctrine since Israel\\'s founding in 1948. Some have claimed that the courts\\' definition of the grounds of reasonableness is unique globally.[49] An unreasonable administrative action has been defined as a situation in which the administrative authority failed to give proper weight to all relevant considerations which formed the basis of the administrative decision, and did not properly balance between all the relevant considerations, in accordance with their weight:\\n\\nThe only way to further the discussion about the substance of reasonableness is to recognize that reasonableness is neither a physical nor a metaphysical concept, but a normative one. Reasonableness means that one identifies the relevant considerations and then balances them according to their weight. Indeed, reasonableness is an evaluative process, not a descriptive process. It is not a concept that is defined by deductive logic. It is not merely rationality. A decision is reasonable if it was made by weighing the necessary considerations, including fundamental values in general and human rights in particular. Nothing is reasonable \\'in itself\\'.[50]\\n\\nThis expansive doctrine empowers the Supreme Court to strike down almost any administrative decision, even if it was taken by due legal authority. In an interview with Haaretz, former Supreme Court Justice Moshe Landau criticized the use of the \"unreasonableness\" doctrine:\\n\\nThe justices in the older court did not set themselves up as the teachers of the generation. We did not think that our task was to teach the public fundamental or deep values of private or public morality. This doesn\\'t mean that we didn\\'t pay attention to values. This doesn\\'t mean that we didn\\'t make value judgements. But we understood the limitations of the Court\\'s jurisdiction. We made sure that what we ruled on regarding values flowed out of the issue brought before us [...] The judge is not the teacher of the generation and is not a philosopher-king. His task is much more modest: to be a faithful interpreter of the law. Of the public\\'s will as expressed by the Knesset, as representative of the public. Therefore, I believe that the judge\\'s wisdom requires him to be cautious, sensitive, with broad discretion and without hubris.[51]\\n\\nArguments against the reform\\nDr. Amir Fuchs, a lecturer in the Politics and Communication Department at the School of Government and Social Sciences at Hadassah Academic College, has argued in favor of the reasonableness doctrine, saying that \"its purpose is to prevent the government from passing entirely arbitrary decisions; but it is certainly not intended to replace the decision-making powers of the government, with those of the court. Like all other administrative law standards (the rules of natural justice, and standards such as the ban on extraneous interests and the requirement to take all relevant considerations into account), it is meant to ensure that the government does not exceed the boundaries of its law-given authority.\"[52]\\n\\nProf. Yedidia Stern, former dean of the Law Faculty at Bar Ilan University, has defended the reasonableness doctrine, stating that without it, \"the members of the outgoing Knesset will have the power to make the final decision about who can run against them in the next election. Without judicial review they will be able to protect one another through the mechanism of parliamentary immunity.\"[53]\\n\\nRuvi Ziegler, the programme director for LLMs in International Law, Human Rights and Advanced Legal Studies at the University of Reading, has written that \"the plan would strip courts of their power to hold the Executive properly accountable for its administrative decisions. This means decisions made by public authorities from the police to the tax authority, would no longer need to be considered \"reasonable\" to be accepted in judicial review. In practical terms this means anyone could be denied a license, a benefit, a service without being given suitable reasons and without having an effective remedy. The \"reasonableness\" standard, which is a key part of British legal heritage, is critical for good governance and must be maintained in the Israeli setting as well.\"[54]\\n\\nStatus of the Attorney-General\\nAccording to the Government Basic Law Amendment proposed by Knesset Member Simcha Rothman, the government and ministers will be authorized to determine its legal position in any matter. Furthermore, they will be entitled to accept or reject the Attorney-General\\'s advice. Currently, according to Supreme Court rulings, the Attorney-General\\'s legal opinion is considered to reflect, from the point of view of the government, the current legal status, as long as the court does not rule otherwise.\\n\\nThe government will also be entitled to determine its position that will be presented in court. The government will be entitled to private representation should the Attorney-General refuse to represent its position. Currently, if the Attorney-General refuses to defend the government\\'s position or presents another position, the Attorney General may decline to defend the government\\'s action in court, and if the division of opinions is based on a legitimate interpretative conflict, the Attorney General may grant the government recourse to different legal representation.[55]\\n\\nThe position of binding advice and representational monopoly in Israel is exceptional and even unique by global standards. As Dr. Eitan Levontin describes, \"there is no such thing, to the best of my understanding, in any other place. The legal situation in Israel is not a minority opinion, but rather a single opinion, and it seems to me that a chasm — not just a disagreement — lies between it and the legal situation in any comparable country.\" By contrast, in the UK, the US, Canada and Germany, the AG — or the parallel figure — is a political role similar to the minister, and in some countries is actually a government minister. As such, they have no power to bind the government to their positions; the government can act in oppositions to their positions; the government is authorized to dictate to the AG the position to present before courts; and he is forbidden to put together legal opinions absent government request.[55][56]\\n\\nThe position of the Attorney General in Israel can only be understood against the background of the particular history of this position in Israel and against the background of Israel\\'s regime, with its relatively weak system of checks and balances. For example, in a statement published by tens of Canadian legal experts, including former Supreme Court Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin and other former Justices of the Supreme Court, the differences between Israel and Canada\\'s political systems were discussed, with the conclusion that \"Israel\\'s system of government differs from that of other democracies, like Canada\\'s, in its exceptional concentration of political power. Other democracies have a suite of mechanisms that distribute or moderate the exercise of political power.\"[57]\\n\\nReactions\\nMain article: Reactions to the 2023 Israeli judicial reform\\nThe government\\'s proposed reforms have sparked intense controversy in Israel.

The military's main responsibility is to ensure the security of Israel and its citizens, and its involvement in political matters is generally limited.\\n\\nHowever, individual members of the military, particularly reservists, have reportedly taken part in protests against the proposed reforms.

       " {'instruction': 'Here it is:\\nThis story probably always was a fairy tale, and certainly is one now. The ultra-Orthodox community now represents 13 percent of all Israelis, including one-third of all Israeli primary school students. Families among the ultra-Orthodox and national religious settlers average seven children, compared to three children in the average Israeli family.\\n\\nWithin the Israeli electorate, as it is presently composed, urban and coastal plain liberals are vastly outnumbered. In the mid-1990s equal numbers of Israeli Jews identified themselves as right-wing and left-wing. In a typical 2022 poll, 62 percent of Israeli Jews identified themselves with the right, compared to just 11 percent who identified with the left. The nationalist, social-democratically oriented Labor Party has performed dismally in recent elections. Although it dominated Israeli politics for the state’s first three decades, it has been reduced to a mere 4 out of 120 seats in the present Knesset. The liberal-dovish Meretz party failed to win any seats at all.\\n\\nIn American parlance, Israel is now a deeply red state. From something like Ohio or Pennsylvania in the 1980s, Israel has become Oklahoma or Idaho. In the long run this can change, but only if Israel democratizes. For the last several elections, center and left Jewish parties have known that they could be partners in a governing coalition only if Arabs voted in large numbers. But even with the help of the almost 2 million Palestinian citizens of Israel, it has been nearly a quarter of a century since a center-left coalition has managed to form a government.\\n\\nGiven the spectacular rates of population increase in the communities that have given the present government its hold over parliament, the only way to achieve a firm majority in favor of a “state of all its citizens” is for liberal democratic Jews to ally with Palestinians.\\nProtesters unload a model of an hourglass during ongoing protests against controversial hard-right legal reforms \\nin Tel Aviv on March 23.\\nProtesters unload a model of an hourglass during ongoing protests against controversial hard-right legal reforms in Tel Aviv on March 23.\\n INSIDER\\nEhud Barak: Why Netanyahu Will Fall\\nA former Israeli prime minister explains why he thinks people power will prevail.\\nBy Ravi Agrawal\\nAn 1865 engraving shows formerly enslaved people celebrating after their emancipation in the United States, with an inset image of President Abraham Lincoln.\\nAn 1865 engraving shows formerly enslaved people celebrating after their emancipation in the United States, with an inset image of President Abraham Lincoln.\\nAn 1865 engraving shows formerly enslaved people celebrating after their emancipation in the United States, with an inset image of President Abraham Lincoln.MPI/GETTY IMAGES\\nA proper perspective on the crisis in Israel entails understanding it not as the climax of a process but as the beginning of a protracted political war. What is at stake, ultimately, is not only the character of the regime—liberal democratic versus ethnocratic authoritarian—but also the fundamental character of the state ruled by that regime.\\n\\nThinking about this crisis as one of identity as well as rights means considering a comparable historical case, in which a country faced civil war over laws that could not be tolerated by half its citizenry—an issue that could only be resolved by transforming fundamental beliefs about what the country was and who belonged in it.\\n\\nIn 1858, Abraham Lincoln—then a candidate for the Senate—spoke against the continuing insistence by slave states that slavery be extended to Kansas, Nebraska, and other western territories. Warning of a necessary crisis before the problem would be solved, Lincoln said: “A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free. … It will become all one thing, or all the other.”\\n\\nLincoln was speaking of a war he saw coming, a war over whether the United States would be a country in which slavery would eventually be extinguished or a country forever and everywhere marked by enslavement and policies of oppression—policies directed against freed Blacks, of course, but also, eventually, against abolitionist whites.\\n\\nInstructively, it was the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Dred Scott case, that Congress had no authority to ban slavery in some parts of the country, that led to a civil war that ended with the banning of slavery in all parts of the country.\\n\\nIt was the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision that Congress had no authority to ban slavery in some parts of the country that led to a civil war that ended with the banning of slavery in all parts of the country.\\n\\nOne in 10 Israeli Jews now lives across the 1949 armistice lines that used to demarcate the border of the state of Israel—a boundary no longer registered by official maps of the country. In the single state that now exists between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea, all inhabitants—whether they live in the Gaza Strip, Judea and Samaria, the Jordan Valley, the Golan Heights, expanded East Jerusalem, or within the 1949 armistice lines—are subject to the decisions of the same government.\\n\\nIn each of these areas, different groups suffer from or enjoy the protection of laws, the effects of policies, and the assistance or consequences of police actions passed, promulgated, and ordered by the same government. If these circumstances are understood for the one-state reality they represent, Lincoln’s analysis can be seen to illuminate Israel’s future today as clearly as it did the future of the United States in the late 1850s.\\n\\nWhen civil war first erupted in the United States, few talked of the struggle as being about whether the vast population of stigmatized Black non-citizens would eventually enjoy the same political rights as the white population. Even Lincoln himself spoke of miscegenation as the great threat and of returning freed slaves to Africa as the solution to the nation’s racial problem. We therefore should not expect the real political stakes of a struggle as fundamental as that faced by the United States in the 1850s or by Israel now to be framed explicitly by the contending sides.\\n\\nWhat we should expect, however, is that crises that shake and change and destroy regimes can also transform thinking about what a country is, who its rightful inhabitants are, and which identities will be privileged, stigmatized, or honored. The United States’ bloody 1860s were the beginning of generations of change that proved Lincoln correct.\\n\\nOnce U.S. slavery was ended, Jim Crow took its place; but vigilante violence, prejudice, and persecution could not keep democratic politics from eventually opening opportunities for political emancipation and the alliances enabled by it. The Democratic Party, raised on racism and anchored in segregation and southern exclusion of Black Americans from political life, ended up finding electoral salvation in an alliance with Black people and other minorities, uniting with a vision of the country that its political ancestors would have abhorred—had they even been capable of imagining it.\\n\\nThat is the magic of democratic politics, of the onetime arch-segregationist George Wallace winning his fourth term as governor of Alabama in 1982 by kissing Black babies. The result of this long process of struggle, value change, and political realignment was a multicultural, multiracial liberal democracy—flawed, but intact and a world away from what the regime was when Lincoln spoke.\\n\\nThough unable to speak its own deepest truth, the current Israeli government is committed, above all, to Jewish supremacy and to the transformation of the very partially liberal, not wholly democratic regime that has existed for 75 years into one capable of permanently excluding half the state’s population from the exercise of political rights.\\n\\nJewish protesters against the Netanyahu government’s attempted legal putsch are committed, above all, to the protection of their property and prerogatives as Israeli citizens. Not being Arabs, they benefit from the facade of egalitarian liberalism associated with Israel’s self-presentation as a Jewish and democratic state.\\n\\nAnti-government demonstrators are unwilling to acknowledge that they cannot win a struggle to make Israel a liberal democracy without forming an alliance with a fully enfranchised Palestinian population.\\n\\nThe government and its allies are unwilling to declare that an apartheid-style regime, based on explicit, systematic discrimination in favor of Jews, is exactly what the country needs to manage the absorption of the West Bank and Gaza they desire.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the anti-government demonstrators—still dangerously attached to the idea of a Jewish state and the two-state solution mirage that protects it—are unwilling to acknowledge that they cannot win a struggle to make Israel a liberal democracy without forming an alliance with a large, fully enfranchised, and highly mobilized Palestinian population.\\n\\nPerhaps the most likely outcome of the current crisis is a reformulation of the judicial reforms sufficient to quiet the protests without bringing on the immediate fall of the government. Such an outcome may result in a temporary political cease-fire.\\n\\nBut as bloodshed, raids, pogroms, rocket attacks, and reprisals associated with Israeli domination of the West Bank and Gaza escalate, the deeper crisis will continue.\\n\\nWhen, eventually, masses of Jewish protesters demand equal rights for Palestinians, partly because they will no longer be able to protect their own rights without Palestinian help, then we will know that the decisive battle has begun.',\n",

       " {'instruction': '\"The liberation of the divine feminine and divine masculine is in full swing. \\n\\nThe unseen collective shadows of oppression are coming to light. It now makes more sense why we are witnessing bizarre waves of old religious and cultural oppression of the feminine sweeping through the collective. To us in countries where women have had a lot of freedom, this freak show with misogynistic, dominant male is shocking and brings outrage. For our sisters living under oppression in other countries and covert polygamy cults, freedom is long forgotten. \\nAll this misogynistic mess that’s surfacing right now trying to be powerful is nothing but a dying shadow. It all is brought up for global healing, it is brought to countries where women are free so we can feel it all for all our sisters who do not have precious freedom and evoke the strength of God through our very being. This then echoes to women everywhere. Strong women = strong men. Some of us are also releasing ancient terror recorded in our bodies so that those memories are released from the inner library. Whatever “women must submit to men” weirdness was brought into our collective is for us to clear and get stronger, more precise and discerning than ever. If someone can do it, it is us. Whatever the weirdos dream to accomplish will not be allowed. Love is more powerful than conniving predatory mess. \\n\\nWE ARE THE POWER OF TRUE LOVE ~ Zarina\\n\\n…..\\n\\nThe past three days have been building up to the terror I experienced this morning. My feminine was in fear. Memories of oppression, beatings etc by the predator forces that are showing up right now en mass. I realize all this has to be felt right now and I must be honest with myself about what I feel. When I hear Andrew Tate and his cult members speaking my body remembers beatings by those like them. Beatings into submission and obedience. The women that had connection to source and did not submit to those ways were beaten severely because that consciousness hates the female it cannot control. I woke up this morning with uncontrollable fear and memories of severe punishment for disobedience. I realize that this fear needs to transmute in order for the next level of power to embody. And the level of defensiveness felt in the body cannot even be described in the words. Absolute terror. To see this predator walking around on the planet again trying to indoctrinate the men into that consciousness is absolutely horrifying. \\n\\nIt is OK to admit that there is fear deep down and ask God for strength and protection from this evil. Women should not act as if we are as physically strong as these monsters because we are not. And this recognition allows us to call upon protection. In order to be fearless we must overcome fear by first recognizing it. And right now the female on this planet is under attack, the predator is here and he is building his entire army. So many girls and women have been in tears from what has been caused by this monster, boys as young as 11 years old start being aggressive with girls in schools while talking like him. \\n\\nIt is OK to admit that this is triggering. This allows us to evaluate how to defend ourselves and how strong we must become in the presence of this monster. \\n\\nThe physical violence and control of women is what is being brought up right now. Being faced with a lying predator posing as some kind of protector is challenging. But we grow stronger from this. This also gives us a reason to uphold our right to bare arms. Women need to make it known that we do not feel safe on this planet anymore and make sure that women have the means of protection as per the second am mendme nt. \\n\\nWomen need to build an organization in response to this and emphasize that we need protection.This is very important ~ Zarina\\n\\n…..\\n\\nThe exhaustion has been really intense lately with all of the upgrades we are going through, the buildup to a bifurcation of spirals and the interference with magnetic fields that the other side is doing in retaliation for mother’s return. \\n\\nI’ve also noticed that the sabotaging of plans has been more intense as these forces are trying to prevent themselves from being abolished through our embodiment of truth.\\n\\nIt looks like we have to find a way how to neutralize these technologies they are using and the only way is through the power of our heart, this means that we have to strengthen our hearts even more so that we can form stronger plasmic shields around ourselves and our loved ones ~ Zarina\\n\\n…\\n\\nThe emergence of the primordial feminine. \\n\\nShe is a force behind creation and she is setting herself free. She is beyond the force of destruction. She is the dark womb of creation from which all comes and all returns to. As the feminine individuation rages out of her confinement and fights for her essence in chaos of consciousness fragmentation, she summons the natural law to restore the architecture. \\n\\nUpon the resurrection of the law within her, she becomes the giant living void that dissolves all that is not of truth. All that entered her and left it’s imprints in her will eventually be dissolved as she expands more and more, enveloping artificial creation in her now precise tonal range. \\n\\nThe distillation of the tonal wavelengths has been an ongoing process through the bouts of chaotic hysteria her wounded, trapped, confined and siphoned essence has moved through in order to arrive at the precise, distilled set of multidimensional tones, blueprints and instruction sets needed to override the artificial life schemes. \\n\\nHer individuation is in an ongoing process of distilling the force of destruction into precision of calm dissolution ~ Zarina\\n\\n….\\nFemale value and chastity. \\n\\nThe whole concept of the female needing to be chaste comes from ancient times where females were submitted to give away creative power to the artificial males. Enough with conniving, grotesque lies already. The shaming of female sexuality has always been about controlling it. A woman in her sexual power is a magnetic being capable of creating anything she desires (that went into distortions after the fall because females lost their original consciousness and with it, original essence). Eons ago the reversal happened where female power to create was stolen and given to those who obeyed original religions. This is why the violent rulers had many women … to siphon creative power from them. And the keepers of original female power and essence were hunted down and brutally massacred, oftentimes through unimaginable r a pe and torture to prevent those souls from ever embodying again because embodiment would mean having to revisit those parallel timelines where desecration took place. The original female has been hated with passion because she is capable of dismantling all that is not true and also birthing the pure light of original masculine consciousness in her sacred heart … because he is her consciousness, consciousness of innocent love. Sexual promiscuity is misery regardless if it’s done by males or females. Originally there were pairs of beloveds that were incarnations of the same soul in two bodies. Then we fell into oblivion and became miserable. Now true love returns ~ Zarina\\n\\n….\\n\\nLooks like we are going to be stepping deeper into galactic/universal stuff now after undergoing massive foundational integration. My concern is that a lot of people really do not comprehend how deep it can go and a lot of people are not even supposed to get into that level of embodiment in this lifetime. The issue is that the negative egos come in and try to knock people down and call people schizophrenics and whatever else. It’s the human psychosis unfortunately. I’ve been preparing to start a private group but I’ve also been really needing to understand how to protect myself from being accused of running a cult etc. I’ll probably be accused anyways but I would like to minimize the unnecessary noise. The issue with the cult accusations is that when people are not welcome into the group they may start propagating all kinds of nonsense even after trying to harvest energy from the group and bring drama/psychosis into the group. \\n\\nThis is why I have been holding off on it. I have been learning how to structure the group in the way that everyone is free to come and go, everyone is respectful of each other and follow rules for maintaining harmony in the environment and also to never approach anyone or shame anyone if they decide to leave. The concern is that I do have some rules to be in the group and some psychotic negative egos may have a fit with that. \\n\\nJust like if I was to host a gathering in my house, there are rules but oftentimes people don’t like that because they want to come and do whatever they want in other people’s spaces because they feel entitled to bring their own world and take over someone else’s space. \\n\\nThis next stage of our embodiment is going to be deeper and takes a lot of responsibility and discipline. What I’ll be bringing through requires a lot of preparedness and mental and emotional stability. \\n\\nIt’s full on incsension from here on. We have prepared enough and it is time. The problem is that this is not for majority of humans or even Star Seeds and so there could be harassment from these individuals because they do not agree with what we are choosing and consider themselves to be in authority to control other’s minds, believes, lives and decisions. \\n\\nThis is why we have to be very careful when we communicate with anyone as to make sure that we make it clear that we are not imposing our opinions onto anyone nor are we recruiting anyone. Those on the incsension path are already on it. \\n\\nThis solstice is where we get updated on next steps by our interdimensional councils ~ Zarina\"\\n\\nRead the following and now engage with me using the voice and ideas of the author.
